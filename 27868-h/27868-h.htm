<h3>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE</h3>
<br>

<p>This is the second volume on Beetles in the complete English edition
of Henri Fabre's entomological works. The first is entitled <i>The
Sacred Beetle and Others;</i> the second and the third will be known as
<i>The Life of the Weevil</i> and <i>More Beetles</i> respectively.</p>

<p><i>The Glow-worm</i>, which gives its name to the present book, did not
form part of the <i>Souvenirs entomologiques</i> as originally published.
It is one of two essays written specially, at my request, for
translation into English, towards the close of Henri Fabre's life; in
fact, this and <i>The Ant-lion</i>, a short essay for children, were the
last works that came from the veteran author's pen. <i>The Glow-worm</i>
appeared first in the <i>Century Magazine</i>. Of the remaining chapters,
several have appeared in various periodicals, notably the <i>English
Review</i> and in <i>Land and Water</i>, the editor and proprietors of which
admirable weekly have shown the most enlightened interest in Fabre's
work.</p>
<a name="pageviii"></a>
<p>A part of the chapter entitled <i>The Dung-beetles of the Pampas</i>
figures in Messrs. Adam &amp; Charles Black's volume, <i>The Life and Love
of the Insect</i> (New York: the Macmillan Co.), translated by myself;
and the chapters on the Capricorn and Burying-beetles will be found
in Mr. T. Fisher Unwin's volume, <i>The Wonders of Instinct</i> (New York:
the Century Co.), translated by myself and Mr. Bernard Miall, which
also contains <i>The Glow-worm</i>. These chapters are included in the
present edition by consent of and arrangement with the publishers
named.</p>

<p>Lastly, Mr. Bernard Miall has earned my gratitude by the valuable
assistance which he has given me in preparing the translation of the
greater part of this volume.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<center>THE GLOW-WORM</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>Few insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the Glow-worm,
that curious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of
life, kindles a beacon at its tail-end. Who does not know it, at
least by name? Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark
fallen from the moon at its full? The Greeks of old called it [Greek:
lampouris], meaning, the bright-tailed. Science employs the same
term: it calls the lantern-bearer, <i>Lampyris noctiluca</i>, LIN. In this
case, the common name is inferior to the scientific phrase, which,
when translated, becomes both expressive and accurate.</p>

<p>In fact, we might easily cavil at the word "worm." The Lampyris is
not a worm at all, not even in general appearance. He has six short
legs, which he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a
trot-about. In the adult state, the male is correctly garbed in
wing-cases, like the true Beetle that he is. The female is an
ill-favoured thing who <a name="page2"></a>knows naught of the delights of flying: all
her life long, she retains the larval shape, which, for the rest, is
similar to that of the male, who himself is imperfect so long as he
has not achieved the maturity that comes with pairing-time. Even in
this initial stage, the word "worm" is out of place. We French have
the expression "Naked as a worm," to point to the lack of any
defensive covering. Now the Lampyris is clothed, that is to say, he
wears an epidermis of some consistency; moreover, he is rather richly
coloured: his body is dark brown all over, set off with pale pink on
the thorax, especially on the lower surface. Finally, each segment is
decked at the hinder edge with two spots of a fairly bright red. A
costume like this was never worn by a worm.</p>

<p>Let us leave this ill-chosen denomination and ask ourselves what the
Lampyris feeds upon. That master of the art of gastronomy,
Brillat-Savarin,<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> said:</p>

<p>"Show me what you eat and I will tell you what you are."</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826), author of <i>La
Psychologie du goût</i>.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>A similar question should be addressed, by way of a preliminary, to
every insect whose habits we propose to study, for, from the <a name="page3"></a>least to
the greatest in the zoological progression, the stomach sways the
world; the data supplied by food are the chief of all the documents
of life. Well, in spite of his innocent appearance, the Lampyris is
an eater of flesh, a hunter of game; and he follows his calling with
rare villainy. His regular prey is the Snail.</p>

<p>This detail has long been known to entomologists. What is not so
well-known, what is not known at all yet, to judge by what I have
read, is the curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other
instance anywhere.</p>

<p>Before he begins to feast, the Glow-worm administers an anæsthetic:
he chloroforms his victim, rivalling in the process the wonders of
our modern surgery, which renders the patient insensible before
operating on him. The usual game is a small Snail hardly the size of
a cherry, such as, for instance, <i>Helix variabilis</i>, DRAP., who, in
the hot weather, collects in clusters on the stiff stubble and on
other long, dry stalks, by the roadside, and there remains
motionless, in profound meditation, throughout the scorching summer
days. It is in some such resting-place as this that I have often been
privileged to light upon the Lampyris banqueting on the <a name="page4"></a>prey which he
had just paralyzed on its shaky support by his surgical artifices.</p>

<p>But he is familiar with other preserves. He frequents the edges of
the irrigating-ditches, with their cool soil, their varied
vegetation, a favourite haunt of the mollusc. Here, he treats the
game on the ground; and, under these conditions, it is easy for me to
rear him at home and to follow the operator's performance down to the
smallest detail.</p>

<p>I will try to make the reader a witness of the strange sight. I place
a little grass in a wide glass jar. In this I install a few
Glow-worms and a provision of Snails of a suitable size, neither too
large nor too small, chiefly <i>Helix variabilis</i>. We must be patient
and wait. Above all, we must keep an assiduous watch, for the desired
events come unexpectedly and do not last long.</p>

<p>Here we are at last. The Glow-worm for a moment investigates the
prey, which, according to its habit, is wholly withdrawn in the
shell, except the edge of the mantle, which projects slightly. Then
the hunter's weapon is drawn, a very simple weapon, but one that
cannot be plainly perceived without the aid of a lens. It consists of
two mandibles bent back powerfully into a hook, <a name="page5"></a>very sharp and as
thin as a hair. The microscope reveals the presence of a slender
groove running throughout the length. And that is all.</p>

<p>The insect repeatedly taps the Snail's mantle with its instrument. It
all happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than
bites. As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of
"tweaksies" to express a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something
more like a tickling than a serious pinch. Let us use that word. In
conversing with animals, language loses nothing by remaining
juvenile. It is the right way for the simple to understand one
another.</p>

<p>The Lampyris doles out his tweaks. He distributes them methodically,
without hurrying, and takes a brief rest after each of them, as
though he wished to ascertain the effect produced. Their number is
not great: half-a-dozen, at most, to subdue the prey and deprive it
of all power of movement. That other pinches are administered later,
at the time of eating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything
for certain, because the sequel escapes me. The first few,
however&mdash;there are never many&mdash;are enough to impart inertia and loss
of all feeling to the mollusc, thanks to the prompt, I might <a name="page6"></a>almost
say, lightning methods of the Lampyris, who, beyond a doubt, instils
some poison or other by means of his grooved hooks.</p>

<p>Here is the proof of the sudden efficacity of those twitches, so mild
in appearance: I take the Snail from the Lampyris, who has operated
on the edge of the mantle some four or five times. I prick him with a
fine needle in the fore-part, which the animal, shrunk into its
shell, still leaves exposed. There is no quiver of the wounded
tissues, no reaction against the brutality of the needle. A corpse
itself could not give fewer signs of life.</p>

<p>Here is something even more conclusive: chance occasionally gives me
Snails attacked by the Lampyris while they are creeping along, the
foot slowly crawling, the tentacles swollen to their full extent. A
few disordered movements betray a brief excitement on the part of the
mollusc and then everything ceases: the foot no longer slugs; the
front-part loses its graceful swan-neck curve; the tentacles become
limp and give way under their weight, dangling feebly like a broken
stick. This conditions persists.</p>

<p>Is the Snail really dead? Not at all, for I am free to resuscitate
the seeming corpse. After two or three days of that singular
<a name="page7"></a>condition which is no longer life and yet not death, I isolate the
patient and, although this is not really necessary to success, I give
him a douche which will represent the shower so dear to the
able-bodied mollusc. In about a couple of days, my prisoner, but
lately injured by the Glow-worm's treachery, is restored to his
normal state. He revives, in a manner; he recovers movement and
sensibility. He is affected by the stimulus of a needle; he shifts
his place, crawls, puts out his tentacles, as though nothing unusual
had occurred. The general torpor, a sort of deep drunkenness, has
vanished outright. The dead returns to life. What name shall we give
to that form of existence which, for a time, abolishes the power of
movement and the sense of pain? I can see but one that is
approximately suitable: anæsthesia. The exploits of a host of Wasps
whose flesh-eating grubs are provided with meat that is motionless
though not dead<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> have taught us the skilful art of the paralyzing
insect, which numbs the locomotory nerve-centres with its venom. We
have now a humble little animal that first produces complete
<a name="page8"></a>anæsthesia in its patient. Human science did not in reality invent
this art, which is one of the wonders of our latter-day surgery. Much
earlier, far back in the centuries, the Lampyris and, apparently,
others knew it as well. The animal's knowledge had a long start of
ours; the method alone has changed. Our operators proceed by making
us inhale the fumes of ether or chloroform; the insect proceeds by
injecting a special virus that comes from the mandibular fangs in
infinitesimal doses. Might we not one day be able to benefit by this
hint? What glorious discoveries the future would have in store for
us, if we understood the beastie's secrets better!</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Hunting Wasps</i>, by J. Henri Fabre, translated
by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: <i>passim</i>.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>What does the Lampyris want with anæsthetical talent against a
harmless and moreover eminently peaceful adversary, who would never
begin the quarrel of his own accord? I think I see. We find in
Algeria a Beetle known as <i>Drilus maroccanus</i>, who, though
non-luminous, approaches our Glow-worm in his organization and
especially in his habits. He too feeds on land molluscs. His prey is
a Cyclostome with a graceful spiral shell, tight-closed with a stony
lid which is attached to the animal by a powerful muscle. The lid is
a movable door which is <a name="page9"></a>quickly shut by the inmate's mere withdrawal
into his house and as easily opened when the hermit goes forth. With
this system of closing, the abode becomes inviolable; and the Drilus
knows it.</p>

<p>Fixed to the surface of the shell by an adhesive apparatus whereof
the Lampyris will presently show us the equivalent, he remains on the
look-out, waiting, if necessary, for whole days at a time. At last,
the need of air and food oblige the besieged noncombatant to show
himself; at least, the door is set slightly ajar. That is enough. The
Drilus is on the spot and strikes his blow. The door can no longer be
closed and the assailant is henceforth master of the fortress. Our
first impression is that the muscle moving the lid has been cut with
a quick-acting pair of shears. This idea must be dismissed. The
Drilus is not well enough equipped with jaws to gnaw through a fleshy
mass so promptly. The operation has to succeed at once, at the first
touch: if not, the animal attacked would retreat, still in full
vigour, and the siege must be recommenced, as arduous as ever,
exposing the insect to fasts indefinitely prolonged. Although I have
never come across the Drilus, who is a stranger to my district, I
conjecture a method of attack <a name="page10"></a>very similar to that of the Glow-worm.
Like our own Snail-eater, the Algerian insect does not cut its victim
into small pieces: it renders it inert, chloroforms it by means of a
few tweaks which are easily distributed, if the lid but half-opens
for a second. That will do. The besieger thereupon enters and, in
perfect quiet, consumes a prey incapable of the least muscular
effort. That is how I see things by the unaided light of logic.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the Glow-worm. When the Snail is on the ground,
creeping, or even shrunk into his shell, the attack never presents
any difficulty. The shell possesses no lid and leaves the hermit's
fore-part to a great extent exposed. Here, on the edges of the mantle
contracted by the fear of danger, the mollusc is vulnerable and
incapable of defence. But it also frequently happens that the Snail
occupies a raised position, clinging to the tip of a grass-stalk or
perhaps to the smooth surface of a stone. This support serves him as
a temporary lid; it wards off the aggression of any churl who might
try to molest the inhabitant of the cabin, always on the express
condition that no slit show itself anywhere on the protecting
circumference. If, on the other hand, in the frequent case when the
shell does not fit its <a name="page11"></a>support quite closely, some point, however
tiny, be left uncovered, this is enough for the subtle tools of the
Lampyris, who just nibbles at the mollusc and at once plunges him
into that profound immobility which favours the tranquil proceedings
of the consumer.</p>

<p>These proceedings are marked by extreme prudence. The assailant has
to handle his victim gingerly, without provoking contractions which
would make the Snail let go his support and, at the very least,
precipitate him from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfully
slumbering. Now any game falling to the ground would seem to be so
much sheer loss, for the Glow-worm has no great zeal for
hunting-expeditions: he profits by the discoveries which good luck
sends him, without undertaking assiduous searches. It is essential,
therefore, that the equilibrium of a prize perched on the top of a
stalk and only just held in position by a touch of glue should be
disturbed as little as possible during the onslaught; it is necessary
that the assailant should go to work with infinite circumspection and
without producing pain, lest any muscular reaction should provoke a
fall and endanger the prize. As we see, sudden and profound
anæsthesia is an excellent means of <a name="page12"></a>enabling the Lampyris to attain
his object, which is to consume his prey in perfect quiet.</p>

<p>What is his manner of consuming it? Does he really eat, that is to
say, does he divide his food piecemeal, does he carve it into minute
particles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus? I
think not. I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives'
mouths. The Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word:
he drinks his fill; he feeds on a thin gruel into which he transforms
his prey by a method recalling that of the maggot. Like the
flesh-eating grub of the Fly, he too is able to digest before
consuming; he liquefies his prey before feeding on it.</p>

<p>This is how things happen: a Snail has been rendered insensible by
the Glow-worm. The operator is nearly always alone, even when the
prize is a large one, like the Common Snail, <i>Helix aspersa</i>. Soon a
number of guests hasten up&mdash;two, three or more&mdash;and, without any
quarrel with real proprietor, all alike fall to. Let us leave them to
themselves for a couple of days and then turn the shell, with the
opening downwards. The contents flow out as easily as would soup from
an overturned saucepan. When the <a name="page13"></a>sated diners retire from this gruel,
only insignificant leavings remain.</p>

<p>The matter is obvious: by repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks
which we saw distributed at the outset, the flesh of the mollusc is
converted into a gruel on which the various banqueters nourish
themselves without distinction, each working at the broth by means of
some special pepsine and each taking his own mouthfuls of it. In
consequence of this method, which first converts the food into a
liquid, the Glow-worm's mouth must be very feebly armed apart from
the two fangs which sting the patient and inject the anæsthetic
poison and, at the same time, no doubt, the serum capable of turning
the solid flesh into fluid. These two tiny implements, which can just
be examined through the lens, must, it seems, have some other object.
They are hollow and in this resemble those of the Ant-lion, which
sucks and drains its capture without having to divide it; but there
is this great difference, that the Ant-lion leaves copious remnants,
which are afterwards flung outside the funnel-shaped trap dug in the
sand, whereas the Glow-worm, that expert liquefier, leaves nothing,
or next to nothing. With similar tools, the one simply sucks the
blood of its <a name="page14"></a>prey and the other turns every morsel of his to account,
thanks to a preliminary liquefaction.</p>

<p>And this is done with exquisite precision, though the equilibrium is
sometimes anything but steady. My rearing-glasses supply me with
magnificent examples. Crawling up the sides, the Snails imprisoned in
my apparatus sometimes reach the top, which is closed with a glass
pane, and fix themselves to it by means of a speck of glair. This is
a mere temporary halt, in which the mollusc is miserly with its
adhesive product, and the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell
and send it to the bottom of the jar.</p>

<p>Now it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself to the top,
with the help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for his weak
legs. He selects his quarry, makes a minute inspection of it to find
an entrance-slit, nibbles it a little, renders it insensible and,
without delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will consume
for days on end.</p>

<p>When he leaves the table, the shell is found to be absolutely empty;
and yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass by a very faint
stickiness, has not come loose, has not even shifted its position in
the smallest degree: without any protest from the hermit <a name="page15"></a>gradually
converted into broth, it has been drained on the very spot at which
the first attack was delivered. These small details tell us how
promptly the anæsthetic bite takes effect; they teach us how
dexterously the Glow-worm treats his Snail without causing him to
fall from a very slippery vertical support and without even shaking
him on his slight line of adhesion.</p>

<p>Under these conditions of equilibrium, the operator's short, clumsy
legs are obviously not enough; a special accessory apparatus is
needed to defy the danger of slipping and to seize the unseizable.
And this apparatus the Lampyris possesses. At the hinder end of the
animal we see a white spot which the lens separates into some dozen
short, fleshy appendages, sometimes gathered into a cluster,
sometimes spread into a rosette. There is your organ of adhesion and
locomotion. If he would fix himself somewhere, even on a very smooth
surface, such as a grass-stalk, the Glow-worm opens his rosette and
spreads it wide on the support, to which it adheres by its own
stickiness. The same organ, rising and falling, opening and closing,
does much to assist the act of progression. In short, the Glow-worm
is a new sort of self-propelled cripple, who decks his <a name="page16"></a>hind-quarters
with a dainty white rose, a kind of hand with twelve fingers, not
jointed, but moving in every direction: tubular fingers which do not
seize, but stick.</p>

<p>The same organ serves another purpose: that of a toilet-sponge and
brush. At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm passes and
repasses the said brush over his head, back, sides and hinder-parts,
a performance made possible by the flexibility of his spine. This is
done point by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a
scrupulous persistency that proves the great interest which he takes
in the operation. What is his object in thus sponging himself, in
dusting and polishing himself so carefully? It is a question,
apparently, of removing a few atoms of dust or else some traces of
viscidity that remain from the evil contact with the snail. A wash
and brush-up is not superfluous when one leaves the tub in which the
mollusc has been treated.</p>

<p>If the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming
his prey by means of a few tweaks resembling kisses, he would be
unknown to the vulgar herd; but he also knows how to light himself
like a beacon; he shines, which is an excellent manner of achieving
fame. Let us consider <a name="page17"></a>more particularly the female, who, while
retaining her larval shape, becomes marriageable and glows at her
best during the hottest part of summer. The lighting-apparatus
occupies the last three segments of the abdomen. On each of the first
two, it takes the form, on the ventral surface, of a wide belt
covering almost the whole of the arch; on the third, the luminous
part is much less and consists simply of two small crescent-shaped
markings, or rather two spots which shine through to the back and are
visible both above and below the animal. Belts and spots emit a
glorious white light, delicately tinged with blue. The general
lighting of the Glow-worm thus comprises two groups: first, the wide
belts of the two segments preceding the last; secondly, the two spots
of the final segments. The two belts, the exclusive attribute of the
marriageable female, are the part richest in light: to glorify her
wedding, the future mother dons her brightest gauds; she lights her
two resplendent scarves. But, before that, from the time of the
hatching, she had only the modest rush-light of the stern. This
efflorescence of light is the equivalent of the final metamorphosis,
which is usually represented by the gift of wings and flight. Its
brilliance heralds the <a name="page18"></a>pairing-time. Wings and flight there will be
none: the female retains her humble larval form, but she kindles her
blazing beacon.</p>

<p>The male, on his side, is fully transformed, changes his shape,
acquires wings and wing-cases; nevertheless, like the female, he
possesses, from the time when he is hatched, the pale lamp of the end
segment. This luminous aspect of the stern is characteristic of the
entire Glow-worm tribe, independently of sex and season. It appears
upon the budding grub and continues throughout life unchanged. And we
must not forget to add that it is visible on the dorsal as well as on
the ventral surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the
female shine only under the abdomen.</p>

<p>My hand is not so steady nor my sight so good as once they were, but,
as far as they allow me, I consult anatomy for the structure of the
luminous organs. I take a scrap of the epidermis and manage to
separate pretty neatly half of one of the shining belts. I place my
preparation under the microscope. On the skin, a sort of white-wash
lies spread, formed of a very fine, granular substance. This is
certainly the light-producing matter. To examine this white layer
more closely is beyond the power of my weary eyes. Just <a name="page19"></a>beside it is
a curious air-tube, whose short and remarkably wide stem branches
suddenly into a sort of bushy tuft of very delicate ramifications.
These creep over the luminous sheet, or even dip into it. That is
all.</p>

<p>The luminescence, therefore, is controlled by the respiratory organs
and the work produced is an oxidization. The white sheet supplies the
oxidizable matter and the thick air-tube spreading into a tufty bush
distributes the flow of air over it. There remains the question of
the substance whereof this sheet is formed. The first suggestion was
phosphorus, in the chemist's sense of the word. The Glow-worm has
been calcined and treated with the violent reagents that bring the
simple substances to light; but no one, so far as I know, has
obtained a satisfactory answer along these lines. Phosphorus seems to
play no part here, in spite of the name of phosphorescence which is
sometimes bestowed upon the Glow-worm's gleam. The answer lies
elsewhere, no one knows where.</p>

<p>We are better informed as regards another question. Has the Glow-worm
a free control of the light which he emits? Can he turn it on or down
or put it out as he pleases? Has he an opaque screen which <a name="page20"></a>is drawn
over the flame at will, or is that flame always left exposed? There
is no need for any such mechanism: the insect has something better
for its revolving light.</p>

<p>The thick tube supplying the light-producing sheet increases the flow
of air and the light is intensified; the same air-tube, swayed by the
animal's will, slackens or even suspends the passage of air and the
light grows fainter or even goes out. It is, in short, the mechanism
of a lamp which is regulated by the access of air to the wick.</p>

<p>Excitement can set the attendant air-duct in motion. We must here
distinguish between two cases: that of the gorgeous scarves, the
exclusive ornament of the female ripe for matrimony, and that of the
modest fairy-lamp on the last segment, which both sexes kindle at any
age. In the second case, the extinction caused by a flurry is sudden
and complete, or nearly so. In my nocturnal hunts for young
Glow-worms, measuring about 5 millimetres long,<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> I can plainly see
the glimmer on the blades of grass; but, should the least false step
disturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at once and the
coveted insect becomes invisible. Upon the full-grown females, lit up
with their <a name="page21"></a>nuptial scarves, even a violent start has but a slight
effect and often none at all.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> .195 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>I fire a gun beside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing my
menagerie of females in the open air. The explosion produces no
result. The illumination continues, as bright and placid as before. I
take a spray and rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the
flock. Not one of my animals puts out its light; at the very most,
there is a brief pause in the radiance; and then only in some cases.
I send a puff of smoke from my pipe into the cage. This time, the
pause is more marked. There are even some extinctions, but these do
not last long. Calm soon returns and the light is renewed as brightly
as ever. I take some of the captives in my fingers, turn and return
them, tease them a little. The illumination continues and is not much
diminished, if I do not press too hard with my thumb. At this period,
with the pairing close at hand, the insect is in all the fervour of
its passionate splendour; and nothing short of very serious reasons
would make it put out its signals altogether.</p>

<p>All things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm
himself manages his lighting-apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling
it at will; but there is one point at <a name="page22"></a>which the voluntary agency of
the insect is without effect. I detach a strip of the epidermis
showing one of the luminescent sheets and place it in a glass tube,
which I close with a plug of damp wadding, to avoid too rapid an
evaporation. Well, this scrap of carcass shines away merrily,
although not quite as brilliantly as on the living body.</p>

<p>Life's aid is now superfluous. The oxidizable substance, the
luminescent sheet, is in direct communication with the surrounding
atmosphere; the flow of oxygen through an air-tube is not necessary;
and the luminous emission continues to take place, in the same way as
when it is produced by the contact of the air with the real
phosphorus of the chemists. Let us add that, in aerated water, the
luminousness continues as brilliant as in the free air, but that it
is extinguished in water deprived of its air by boiling. No better
proof could be found of what I have already propounded, namely, that
the Glow-worm's light is the effect of a slow oxidization.</p>

<p>The light is white, calm and soft to the eyes and suggests a spark
dropped by the full moon. Despite its splendour, it is a very feeble
illuminant. If we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect
darkness, we can easily make out the letters, one by one, <a name="page23"></a>and even
words, when these are not too long; but nothing more is visible
beyond a narrow zone. A lantern of this kind soon tires the reader's
patience.</p>

<p>Suppose a group of Glow-worms placed almost touching one another.
Each of them sheds its glimmer, which ought, one would think, to
light up its neighbours by reflexion and give us a clear view of each
individual specimen. But not at all: the luminous party is a chaos in
which our eyes are unable to distinguish any definite form at a
medium distance. The collective lights confuse the link-bearers into
one vague whole.</p>

<p>Photography gives us a striking proof of this. I have a score of
females, all at the height of their splendour, in a wire-gauze cage
in the open air. A tuft of thyme forms a grove in the centre of their
establishment. When night comes, my captives clamber to this pinnacle
and strive to show off their luminous charms to the best advantage at
every point of the horizon, thus forming along the twigs marvellous
clusters from which I expected magnificent effects on the
photographer's plates and paper. My hopes are disappointed. All that
I obtain is white, shapeless patches, denser here and less dense
there according to the numbers forming the <a name="page24"></a>group. There is no picture
of the Glow-worms themselves; not a trace either of the tuft of
thyme. For want of satisfactory light, the glorious firework is
represented by a blurred splash of white on a black ground.</p>

<p>The beacons of the female Glow-worms are evidently nuptial signals,
invitations to the pairing; but observe that they are lighted on the
lower surface of the abdomen and face the ground, whereas the
summoned males, whose flights are sudden and uncertain, travel
overhead, in the air, sometimes a great way up. In its normal
position, therefore, the glittering lure is concealed from the eyes
of those concerned; it is covered by the thick bulk of the bride. The
lantern ought really to gleam on the back and not under the belly;
otherwise the light is hidden under a bushel.</p>

<p>The anomaly is corrected in a very ingenious fashion, for every
female has her little wiles of coquetry. At nightfall, every evening,
my caged captives make for the tuft of thyme with which I have
thoughtfully furnished the prison and climb to the top of the upper
branches, those most in sight. Here, instead of keeping quiet, as
they did at the foot of the bush just now, they indulge in violent
exercises, twist the tip of their very <a name="page25"></a>flexible abdomen, turn it to
one side, turn it to the other, jerk it in every direction. In this
way, the search-light cannot fail to gleam, at one moment or another,
before the eyes of every male who goes a-wooing in the neighbourhood,
whether on the ground or in the air.</p>

<p>It is very like the working of the revolving mirror used in catching
Larks. If stationary, the little contrivance would leave the bird
indifferent; turning and breaking up its light in rapid flashes, it
excites it.</p>

<p>While the female Glow-worm has her tricks for summoning her swains,
the male, on his side, is provided with an optical apparatus suited
to catch from afar the least reflection of the calling-signal. His
corselet expands into a shield and overlaps his head considerably in
the form of a peaked cap or eye-shade, the object of which appears to
be to limit the field of vision and concentrate the view upon the
luminous speck to be discerned. Under this arch are the two eyes,
which are relatively enormous, exceedingly convex, shaped like a
skull-cap and contiguous to the extent of leaving only a narrow
groove for the insertion of the antennæ. This double eye, occupying
almost the whole <a name="page26"></a>face of the insect and contained in the cavern
formed by the spreading peak of the corselet, is a regular Cyclop's
eye.</p>

<p>At the moment of the pairing, the illumination becomes much fainter,
is almost extinguished; all that remains alight is the humble
fairy-lamp of the last segment. This discreet night-light is enough
for the wedding, while, all around, the host of nocturnal insects,
lingering over their respective affairs, murmur the universal
marriage-hymn. The laying follows very soon. The round, white eggs
are laid, or rather strewn at random, without the least care on the
mother's part, either on the more or less cool earth or on a blade of
grass. These brilliant ones know nothing at all of family-affection.</p>

<p>Here is a very singular thing: the Glow-worm's eggs are luminous even
when still contained in the mother's womb. If I happen by accident to
crush a female big with germs that have reached maturity, a shiny
streak runs along my fingers, as though I had broken some vessel
filled with a phosphorescent fluid. The lens shows me that I am
wrong. The luminosity comes from the cluster of eggs forced out of
the ovary. Besides, as laying-time approaches, the phosphorescence of
the eggs is already made <a name="page27"></a>manifest without this clumsy midwifery. A
soft opalescent light shines through the skin of the belly.</p>

<p>The hatching follows soon after the laying. The young of either sex
have two little rush-lights on the last segment. At the approach of
the severe weather, they go down into the ground, but not very far.
In my rearing-jars, which are supplied with fine and very loose
earth, they descend to a depth of three or four inches at most. I dig
up a few in mid-winter. I always find them carrying their faint
stern-light. About the month of April, they come up again to the
surface, there to continue and complete their evolution.</p>

<p>From start to finish, the Glow-worm's life is one great orgy of
light. The eggs are luminous; the grubs likewise. The full-grown
females are magnificent light-houses, the adult males retain the
glimmer which the grubs already possessed. We can understand the
object of the feminine beacon; but of what use is all the rest of the
pyrotechnic display? To my great regret, I cannot tell. It is and
will be, for many a day to come, perhaps for all time, the secret of
animal physics, which is deeper than the physics of the books.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<center>THE SITARES</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>The high banks of sandy clay in the country round about Carpentras
are the favourite haunts of a host of Bees and Wasps, those lovers of
a thoroughly sunny aspect and of soils that are easy to excavate.
Here, in the month of May, two Anthophoræ<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> are especially abundant,
gatherers of honey and, both of them, makers of subterranean cells.
One, <i>A. parietina</i>, builds at the entrance of her dwelling an
advanced fortification, an earthy cylinder, wrought in open work,
like that of the Odynerus,<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> and curved like it, but of the width
and length of a man's finger. When the community is a populous one,
we stand amazed at the rustic ornamentation formed by all these
stalactites of clay hanging from the façade. The other, <a name="page29"></a><i>A. pilipes</i>,
who is very much more frequent, leaves the opening of her corridor
bare. The chinks between the stones in old walls and abandoned
hovels, the surfaces of excavations in soft sandstone or marl, are
found suitable for her labours; but the favourite spots, those to
which the greatest number of swarms resort, are vertical stretches,
exposed to the south, such as are afforded by the cuttings of deeply
sunken roads. Here, over areas many yards in width, the wall is
drilled with a multitude of holes, which impart to the earthy mass
the look of some enormous sponge. These round holes might be
fashioned with an auger, so regular are they. Each is the entrance to
a winding corridor, which runs to a depth of four to six inches. The
cells are distributed at the far end. If we would witness the labours
of the industrious Bee, we must repair to her workshop during the
latter half of May. Then, but at a respectful distance, if, as
novices, we are afraid of being stung, we may contemplate, in all its
bewildering activity, the tumultuous, buzzing swarm, busied with the
building and the provisioning of the cells.</p>

<p>It is most often during the months of August and September, those
happy months of the summer holidays, that I have visited <a name="page30"></a>the banks
inhabited by the Anthophora. At this period all is silent near the
nests; the work has long been completed; and numbers of Spiders' webs
line the crevices or plunge their silken tubes into the Bee's
corridors. Let us not, however, hastily abandon the city once so
populous, so full of life and bustle and now deserted. A few inches
below the surface, thousands of larvæ and nymphs, imprisoned in their
cells of clay, are resting until the coming spring. Might not such a
succulent prey as these larvæ, paralysed and incapable of defence,
tempt certain parasites who are industrious enough to attain them?</p>

<p>Here indeed are some Flies clad in a dismal livery, half-black,
half-white, a species of Anthrax (<i>A. sinuata</i>),<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> flying indolently
from gallery to gallery, doubtless with the object of laying their
eggs there; and here are others, more numerous, whose mission is
fulfilled and who, having died in harness, are hanging dry and
shrivelled in the Spiders' webs. Elsewhere the entire surface of a
perpendicular bank is hung with the dried corpses of a Beetle
(<i>Sitaris humeralis</i>), slung, like the Flies, in the silken meshes of
<a name="page31"></a>the Spiders. Among these corpses some male Sitares circle, busy,
amorous, heedless of death, mating with the first female that passes
within reach, while the fertilized females thrust their bulky
abdomens into the opening of a gallery and disappear into it
backwards. It is impossible to mistake the situation: some grave
interest attracts to this spot these two insects, which, within a few
days, make their appearance, mate, lay their eggs and die at the very
doors of the Anthophora's dwellings.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Life of the Fly</i>, by J. Henri Fabre, translated
by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chaps. ii. and iv.&mdash;<i>Translator's
Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Let us now give a few blows of the pick to the surface beneath which
the singular incidents already in our mind must be occurring, beneath
which similar things occurred last year; perhaps we shall find some
evidence of the parasitism which we suspected. If we search the
dwellings of the Anthophoræ during the early days of August, this is
what we see: the cells forming the superficial layer are not like
those situated at a greater depth. This difference arises from the
fact that the same establishment is exploited simultaneously by the
Anthophora and by an Osmia (<i>O. tricornis</i>)<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> as is proved by an
observation made at the <a name="page32"></a>working-period, in May. The Anthophoræ are
the actual pioneers, the work of boring the galleries is wholly
theirs; and their cells are situated right at the end. The Osmia
profits by the galleries which have been abandoned either because of
their age, or because of the completion of the cells occupying the
most distant part; she builds her cells by dividing these corridors
into unequal and inartistic chambers by means of rude earthen
partitions. The Osmia's sole achievement in the way of masonry is
confined to these partitions. This, by the way, is the ordinary
building-method adopted by the various Osmiæ, who content themselves
with a chink between two stones, an empty Snail-shell, or the dry and
hollow stem of some plant, wherein to build their stacks of cells, at
small expense, by means of light partitions of mortar.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> Cf. <i>Bramble-bees and Others: passim</i>.&mdash;<i>Translator's
Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The cells of the Anthophora, with their faultless geometrical
regularity and their perfect finish, are works of art, excavated, at
a suitable depth, in the very substance of the loamy bank, without
any manufactured part save the thick lid that closes the orifice.
Thus protected by the prudent industry of their mother, well out of
reach in their distant, solid retreats, the Anthophora's larvæ <a name="page33"></a>are
devoid of the glandular apparatus designed for secreting silk. They
therefore never spin a cocoon, but lie naked in their cells, whose
inner surface has the polish of stucco.</p>

<p>In the Osmia's cells, on the other hand, means of defence are
required, for these are situated in the surface layer of the bank;
they are irregular in form, rough inside and barely protected, by
their thin earthen partitions, against external enemies. The Osmia's
larvæ, in fact, contrive to enclose themselves in an egg-shaped
cocoon, dark brown in colour and very strong, which preserves them
both from the rough contact of their shapeless cells and from the
mandibles of voracious parasites, Acari,<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small>
Cleri<small><small><sup>6</sup></small></small> and Anthreni,<small><small><sup>7</sup></small></small>
those manifold enemies whom we find prowling in the galleries,
seeking whom they may devour. It is by means of this equipoise
between the mother's talents and the larva's that the Osmia and the
Anthophora, in their early youth, escape some part <a name="page34"></a>of the dangers
which threaten them. It is easy therefore, in the bank excavated by
these two Bees, to recognize the property of either species by the
situation and form of the cells and also by their contents, which
consist, with the Anthophora, of a naked larva and, with the Osmia,
of a larva enclosed in a cocoon.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> Mites and Ticks.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>6</sup></small> A genus of Beetles of which certain species (<i>Clerus
apiarius</i> and <i>C. alvearius</i>) pass their preparatory state in the
nests of Bees, where they feed on the grubs.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>7</sup></small> Another genus of Beetles. The grub of <i>A. musæorum</i>, the
Museum Beetle, is very destructive to
insect-collections.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>On opening a certain number of these cocoons, we end by discovering
some which, in place of the Osmia's larva, contain each a curiously
shaped nymph. These nymphs, at the least shock received by their
dwelling, indulge in extravagant movements, lashing the walls with
their abdomen till the whole house shakes and dances. And, even if we
leave the cocoon intact, we are informed of their presence by a dull
rustle heard inside the silken dwelling the moment after we move it.</p>

<p>The fore-part of this nymph is fashioned like a sort of boar's-snout
armed with six strong spikes, a multiple ploughshare, eminently
adapted for burrowing in the soil. A double row of hooks surmounts
the dorsal ring of the four front segments of the abdomen. These are
so many grappling-irons, with whose assistance the creature is
enabled to progress in the narrow gallery dug by the snout. Lastly, a
sheaf of sharp points <a name="page35"></a>forms the armour of the hinder-part. If we
examine attentively the surface of the vertical wall which contains
the various nests, it will not be long before we discover nymphs like
those which we have been describing, with one extremity held in a
gallery of their own diameter, while the fore-part projects freely
into the air. But these nymphs are reduced to their cast skins, along
the back and head of which runs a long slit through which the perfect
insect has escaped. The purpose of the nymph's powerful weapons is
thus made manifest: it is the nymph that has to rend the tough cocoon
which imprisons it, to excavate the tightly-packed soil in which it
is buried, to dig a gallery with its six-pointed snout and thus to
bring to the light the perfect insect, which apparently is incapable
of performing these strenuous tasks for itself.</p>

<p>And in fact these nymphs, taken in their cocoons, have in a few days'
time given me a feeble Fly (<i>Anthrax sinuata</i>) who is quite incapable
of piercing the cocoon and still more of making her exit through a
soil which I cannot easily break up with my pick. Although similar
facts abound in insect history, we always notice them with a lively
interest. They tell us of an incomprehensible power <a name="page36"></a>which suddenly,
at a given moment, irresistibly commands an obscure grub to abandon
the retreat in which it enjoys security, in order to make its way
through a thousand difficulties and to reach the light, which would
be fatal to it on any other occasion, but which is necessary to the
perfect insect, which could not reach it by its own efforts.</p>

<p>But the layer of Osmia-cells has been removed; and the pick now
reaches the Anthophora's cells. Among these cells are some which
contain larvæ and which result from the labours of last May; others,
though of the same date, are already occupied by the perfect insect.
The precocity of metamorphosis varies from one larva to another;
however, a few days' difference of age is enough to explain these
inequalities of development. Other cells, as numerous as the first,
contain a parasitical Hymenopteron, a Melecta (<i>M. armata</i>), likewise
in the perfect state. Lastly, there are some, indeed many, which
contain a singular egg-shaped shell, divided into segments with
projecting breathing-pores. This shell is extremely thin and fragile;
it is amber-coloured and so transparent that one can distinguish
quite plainly, through its sides, an adult Sitaris (<i>S. humeralis</i>),
who occupies the interior and <a name="page37"></a>is struggling as though to set herself
at liberty. This explains the presence here, the pairing and the
egg-laying of the Sitares whom we but now saw roaming, in the company
of the Anthrax-flies, at the entrance to the galleries of the
Anthophoræ. The Osmia and the Anthophora, the joint owners of the
premises, have each their parasite: the Anthrax attacks the Osmia and
the Sitaris the Anthophora.</p>

<p>But what is this curious shell in which the Sitaris is invariably
enclosed, a shell unexampled in the Beetle order? Can this be a case
of parasitism in the second degree, that is, can the Sitaris be
living inside the chrysalis of a first parasite, which itself exists
at the cost of the Anthophora's larva or of its provisions? And, even
so, how can this parasite, or these parasites, obtain access to a
cell which seems to be inviolable, because of the depth at which it
lies, and which, moreover, does not reveal, to the most careful
examination under the magnifying-glass, any violent inroad on the
enemy's part? These are the questions that presented themselves to my
mind when for the first time, in 1855, I observed the facts which I
have just related. Three years of assiduous observation enabled me to
add one of its most astonishing <a name="page38"></a>chapters to the story of the
formation of insects.</p>

<p>After collecting a fairly large number of these enigmatical shells
containing adult Sitares, I had the satisfaction of observing, at
leisure, the emergence of the perfect insect from the shell, the act
of pairing and the laying of the eggs. The shell is easily broken; a
few strokes of the mandibles, distributed at random, a few kicks are
enough to deliver the perfect insect from its fragile prison.</p>

<p>In the glass jars in which I kept my Sitares I saw the pairing follow
very closely upon the first moments of freedom. I even witnessed a
fact which shows emphatically how imperious, in the perfect insect,
is the need to perform, without delay, the act intended to ensure the
preservation of its race. A female, with her head already cut out of
the shell, is anxiously struggling to release herself entirely; a
male, who has been free for a couple of hours, climbs on the shell
and, tugging here and there, with his mandibles, at the fragile
envelope, strives to deliver the female from her shackles. His
efforts are soon crowned with success; and, though the female is
still three parts swathed in her swaddling-bands, the coupling takes
place immediately, lasting about a minute. During <a name="page39"></a>the act, the male
remains motionless on the top of the shell, or on the top of the
female when the latter is entirely free. I do not know whether, in
ordinary circumstances, the male occasionally thus helps the female
to gain her liberty; to do so he would have to penetrate into a cell
containing a female, which, after all, is not beyond his powers,
seeing that he has been able to escape from his own. Still, on the
actual site of the cells, the coupling is generally performed at the
entrance to the galleries of the Anthophoræ; and then neither of the
sexes drags about with it the least shred of the shell from which it
has emerged.</p>

<p>After mating, the two Sitares proceed to clean their legs and antennæ
by drawing them between their mandibles; then each goes his own way.
The male cowers in a crevice of the earthen bank, lingers for two or
three days and perishes. The female also, after getting rid of her
eggs, which she does without delay, dies at the entrance to the
corridor in which the eggs are laid. This is the origin of all those
corpses swinging in the Spiders' web with which the neighbourhood of
the Anthophora's dwellings is upholstered.</p>

<p>Thus the Sitares in the perfect state live long enough only to mate
and to lay their <a name="page40"></a>eggs. I have never seen one save upon the scene of
their loves, which is also that of their death; I have never
surprised one browsing on the plants near at hand, so that, though
they are provided with a normal digestive apparatus, I have grave
reasons to doubt whether they actually take any nourishment whatever.
What a life is theirs! A fortnight's feasting in a storehouse of
honey; a year of slumber underground; a minute of love in the
sunlight; then death!</p>

<p>Once fertilized, restlessly the female at once proceeds to seek a
favourable spot wherein to lay her eggs. It was important to note
where this exact spot is. Does the female go from cell to cell,
confiding an egg to the succulent flanks of each larva, whether this
larva belong to the Anthophora or to a parasite of hers, as the
mysterious shell whence the Sitaris emerges would incline one to
believe? This method of laying the eggs, one at a time in each cell,
would appear to be essential, if we are to explain the facts already
ascertained. But then why do the cells usurped by the Sitares retain
not the slightest trace of the forcible entry which is indispensable?
And how is it that, in spite of lengthy investigations during which
my <a name="page41"></a>perseverance has been kept up by the keenest desire to cast some
light upon all these mysteries, how is it, I say, that I have never
come across a single specimen of the supposed parasites to which the
shell might be attributed, since this shell appears not to be a
Beetle's? The reader would hardly suspect how my slight acquaintance
with entomology was unsettled by this inextricable maze of
contradictory facts. But patience! We may yet obtain some light.</p>

<p>Let us begin by observing precisely at what spot the eggs are laid. A
female has just been fertilized before my eyes; she is forthwith
placed in a large glass jar, into which I put, at the same time, some
clods of earth containing Anthophora-cells. These cells are occupied
partly by larvæ and partly by nymphs that are still quite white; some
are slightly open and afford a glimpse of their contents. Lastly, in
the inner surface of the cork which closes the jar I sink a
cylindrical well, a blind alley, of the same diameter as the
corridors of the Anthophora. In order that the insect, if it so
desire, may enter this artificial corridor, I lay the bottle
horizontally.</p>

<p>The female, painfully dragging her big abdomen, perambulates all the
nooks and <a name="page42"></a>corners of her makeshift dwelling, exploring them with her
palpi, which she passes everywhere. After half an hour of groping and
careful investigation, she ends by selecting the horizontal gallery
dug in the cork. She thrusts her abdomen into this cavity and, with
her head hanging outside, begins her laying. Not until thirty-six
hours later was the operation completed; and during this incredible
lapse of time the patient creature remained absolutely motionless.</p>

<p>The eggs are white, oval and very small. They measure barely
two-thirds of a millimetre<small><small><sup>8</sup></small></small> in length. They stick together slightly
and are piled in a shapeless heap which might be likened to a
good-sized pinch of the unripe seeds of some orchid. As for their
number, I will admit that it tried my patience to no purpose. I do
not, however, believe that I am exaggerating when I estimate it as at
least two thousand. Here are the data on which I base this figure:
the laying, as I have said, lasts thirty-six hours; and my frequent
visits to the female working in the cavity in the cork convinced me
that there was no perceptible interruption in the successive emission
of the eggs. Now less than a minute elapses between the arrival of
one <a name="page43"></a>egg and that of the next; and the number of these eggs cannot
therefore be lower than the number of minutes contained in thirty-six
hours, or 2160. But the exact number is of no importance: we need
only note that it is very large, which implies, for the young larvæ
issuing from the eggs, very numerous chances of destruction, since so
lavish a supply of germs is necessary to maintain the species in the
requisite proportions.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>8</sup></small> .026 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Enlightened by these observations and informed of the shape, the
number and the arrangement of the eggs, I searched the galleries of
the Anthophoræ for those which the Sitares had laid there and
invariably found them gathered in a heap inside the galleries, at a
distance of an inch or two from the orifice, which is always open to
the outer world. Thus, contrary to what one was to some extent
entitled to suppose, the eggs are not laid in the cells of the
pioneer Bee; they are simply dumped in a heap inside the entrance to
her dwelling. Nay more, the mother does not make any protective
structure for them; she takes no pains to shield them from the
rigours of winter; she does not even attempt, by stopping for a short
distance, as best she can, the entrance-lobby in which she has laid
them, to protect them <a name="page44"></a>from the thousand enemies that threaten them;
for, as long as the frosts of winter have not arrived, these open
galleries are trodden by Spiders, by Acari, by Anthrenus-grubs and
other plunderers, to whom these eggs, or the young larvæ about to
emerge from them, must be a dainty feast. In consequence of the
mother's heedlessness, the number of those who escape all these
voracious hunters and the inclemencies of the weather must be
curiously small. This perhaps explains why she is compelled to make
up by her fecundity for her deficient industry.</p>

<p>The hatching occurs a month later, about the end of September or the
beginning of October. The season being still propitious, I was led to
suppose that the young larvæ must at once make a start and disperse,
in order that each might seek to gain access, through some
imperceptible fissure, to an Anthophora-cell. This presumption turned
out to be entirely at fault. In the boxes in which I had placed the
eggs laid by my captives, the young larvæ, little black creatures at
most a twenty-fifth of an inch long, did not move away, provided
though they were with vigorous legs; they remained higgledy-piggledy
with the white skins of the eggs whence they had emerged.</p>
<a name="page45"></a>
<p>In vain I placed within their reach lumps of earth containing nests
of the Anthophora, open cells, larvæ and nymphs of the Bee: nothing
was able to tempt them; they persisted in forming, with the
egg-skins, a powdery heap of speckled black and white. It was only by
drawing the point of a needle through this pinch of living dust that
I was able to provoke an active wriggling. Apart from this, all was
still. If I forcibly removed a few larvæ from the common heap, they
at once hurried back to it, in order to hide themselves among the
rest. Perhaps they had less reason to fear the cold when thus
collected and sheltered beneath the egg-skins. Whatever may be the
motive that impels them to remain thus gathered in a heap, I
recognized that none of the means suggested by my imagination
succeeded in forcing them to abandon the little spongy mass formed by
the skins of the eggs, which were slightly glued together. Lastly, to
assure myself that the larvæ, in the free state, do not disperse
after they are hatched, I went during the winter to Carpentras and
inspected the banks inhabited by the Anthophoræ. There, as in my
boxes, I found the larvæ piled into heaps, all mixed up with the
skins of the eggs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<center>THE PRIMARY LARVA OF THE SITARES</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>Nothing new happens before the end of the following April. I shall
profit by this long period of repose to tell you more about the young
larva, of which I will begin by giving a description. Its length is a
twenty-fifth of an inch, or a little less. It is hard as leather, a
glossy greenish black, convex above and flat below, long and slender,
with a diameter increasing gradually from the head to the hinder
extremity of the metathorax, after which it rapidly diminishes. Its
head is a trifle longer than it is wide and is slightly dilated at
the base; it is pale-red near the mouth and darker about the ocelli.</p>

<p>The labrum forms a segment of a circle; it is reddish, edged with a
small number of very short, stiff hairs. The mandibles are powerful,
red-brown, curved and sharp; when at rest they meet without crossing.
The maxillary palpi are rather long, consisting of two cylindrical
sections of equal length, the outer ending in a very short bristle.
The jaws and the lower lip are not sufficiently <a name="page47"></a>visible to lend
themselves to accurate description.</p>

<p>The antennæ consist of two cylindrical segments, equal in length, not
very definitely divided; these segments are nearly as long as those
of the palpi; the outer is surmounted by a cirrus whose length is as
much as thrice that of the head and tapers off until it becomes
invisible under a powerful pocket-lens. Behind the base of either
antennæ are two ocelli, unequal in size and almost touching.</p>

<p>The thoracic segments are of equal length and increase gradually in
width from front to back. The prothorax is wider than the head, but
is narrower in front than at the base and is slightly rounded at the
sides. The legs are of medium length and fairly robust, ending in a
long, powerful, sharp and very mobile claw. On the haunch and thigh
of each leg is a long cirrus, like that of the antennæ, almost as
long as the whole limb and standing at right angles to the plane of
locomotion when the creature moves. There are a few stiff bristles on
the legs.</p>

<p>The abdomen has nine segments, of practically equal length, but
shorter than those of the thorax and diminishing very rapidly in
width toward the last. Fixed below the eighth segment, or rather
below the strip of <a name="page48"></a>membrane separating this segment and the last, we
see two spikes, slightly curved, short, but with strong, sharp, hard
points, and placed one to the right and the other to the left of the
median line. These two appendages are able, by means of a mechanism
recalling, on a smaller scale, that of the Snail's horns, to withdraw
into themselves, as a result of the membranous character of their
base. They can also retreat under the eighth segment, borne, as they
are, by the anal segment, when this last, as it contracts, withdraws
into the eighth. Lastly, the ninth or anal segment bears on its
hinder edge two long cirri, like those of the legs and the antennæ,
curving backwards from tip to base. At the rear of this segment a
fleshy nipple appears, more or less prominent; this is the anus. I do
not know where the stigmata are placed; they have evaded my
investigations, though these were undertaken with the aid of the
microscope.</p>

<p>When the larva is at rest, the various segments overlap evenly; and
the membranous intervals, corresponding with the articulations, do
not show. But, when the larva walks, all the articulations,
especially those of the abdominal segments, are distended and end by
occupying almost as much <a name="page49"></a>space as the horny arches. At the same time
the anal segment emerges from the sheath formed by the eighth; the
anus, in turn, is stretched into a nipple; and the two points of the
penultimate ring rise, at first slowly, and then suddenly stand up
with an abrupt motion similar to that of a spring when released. In
the end, these two points diverge like the horns of a crescent. Once
this complex apparatus is unfolded, the tiny creature is ready to
crawl upon the most slippery surface.</p>

<p>The last segment and its anal button are curved at right angles to
the axis of the body; and the anus comes and presses upon the surface
of locomotion, where it ejects a tiny drop of transparent, treacly
fluid, which glues and holds the little creature firmly in position,
supported on a sort of tripod formed by the anal button and the two
cirri of the last segment. If we are observing the animal's manner of
locomotion on a strip of glass, we can hold the strip in a vertical
position, or even turn it upside down, or shake it lightly, without
causing the larva to become detached and fall, held fast as it is by
the glutinous secretion of the anal button.</p>

<p>If it has to proceed along a surface where there is no danger of a
fall, the microscopic <a name="page50"></a>creature employs another method. It crooks its
belly and, when the two spikes of the eighth segment, now fully
outspread, have found a firm support by ploughing, so to speak, the
surface of locomotion, it bears upon that base and pushes forward by
expanding the various abdominal articulations. This forward movement
is also assisted by the action of the legs, which are far from
remaining inactive. This done, it casts anchor with the powerful
claws of its feet; the abdomen contracts; the various segments draw
together; and the anus, pulled forward, obtains a fresh purchase,
with the aid of the two spikes, before beginning the second of these
curious strides.</p>

<p>During these manoeuvres, the cirri of the flanks and thighs drag
along the supporting surface and by their length and elasticity
appear fitted only to impede progress. But let us not be in a hurry
to conclude that we have discovered an inconsistency: the least of
creatures is adapted to the conditions amid which it has to live;
there is reason to believe that these filaments, far from hampering
the pigmy's progress, must, in normal circumstances, be of some
assistance to it.</p>

<p>Even the little that we have just learnt shows us that the young
Sitaris-larva is not <a name="page51"></a>called upon to move on an ordinary surface. The
spot, whatever it may be like, where this larva is to live later
exposes it to the risk of many dangerous falls, since, in order to
prevent them, it is not only equipped with strong and extremely
mobile talons and a steel-shod crescent, a sort of ploughshare
capable of biting into the most highly polished substance, but is
further provided with a viscous liquid, sufficiently tenacious and
adhesive to hold it in position without the help of other appliances.
In vain I racked my brains to guess what the substance might be, so
shifting, so uncertain and so perilous, which the young Sitares are
destined to inhabit; and I discovered nothing to explain the
necessity for the structure which I have described. Convinced
beforehand, by an attentive examination of this structure, that I
should witness some peculiar habits, I waited with eager impatience
for the return of the warm weather, never doubting that by dint of
persevering observation the mystery would be disclosed to me next
spring. At last this spring, so fervently desired, arrived; I brought
to bear all the patience, all the imagination, all the insight and
discernment that I may possess; but, to my utter shame and still
greater regret, the secret escaped me. Oh, how <a name="page52"></a>painful are those
tortures of indecision, when one has to postpone till the following
year an investigation which has led to no result!</p>

<p>My observations made during the spring of 1856, although purely
negative, nevertheless have an interest of their own, because they
prove the inaccuracy of certain suppositions to which the undeniable
parasitism of the Sitares naturally inclines us. I will therefore
relate them in a few words. At the end of April, the young larvæ,
hitherto motionless and concealed in the spongy heap of the
egg-skins, emerge from their immobility, scatter and run about in all
directions through the boxes and jars in which they have passed the
winter. By their hurried gait and their indefatigable evolutions we
readily guess that they are seeking something which they lack. What
can this something be, unless it be food? For remember that these
larvæ were hatched at the end of September and that since then, that
is to say, for seven long months, they have taken no nourishment,
though they have spent this period in the full enjoyment of their
vitality, as I was able to assure myself all through the winter by
irritating them, and not in a state of torpor similar to that of the
hibernating animals. <a name="page53"></a>From the moment of their hatching they are
doomed, although full of life, to an absolute abstinence of seven
months' duration; and it is natural to suppose, when we see their
present excitement, that an imperious hunger sets them bustling in
this fashion.</p>

<p>The desired nourishment could only be the contents of the cells of
the Anthophora, since we afterwards find the Sitares in these cells.
Now these contents are limited to honey or larvæ. It just happens
that I have kept some Anthophora-cells occupied by larvæ or nymphs. I
place a few of these, some open, some closed, within reach of the
young Sitares, as I had already done directly after the hatching. I
even slip the Sitares into the cells: I place them on the sides of
the larva, a succulent morsel to all appearances; I do all sorts of
things to tempt their appetite; and, after exhausting my ingenuity,
which continues fruitless, I remain convinced that my famished grubs
are seeking neither the larvæ nor nymphs of the Anthophora.</p>

<p>Let us now try honey. We must obviously employ honey prepared by the
same species of Anthophora as that at whose cost the Sitares live.
But this Bee is not very common in the neighbourhood of Avignon; and
<a name="page54"></a>my engagements at the college<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> do not allow me to absent myself for
the purpose of repairing to Carpentras, where she is so abundant. In
hunting for cells provisioned with honey I thus lose a good part of
the month of May; however, I end by finding some which are newly
sealed and which belong to the right Anthophora. I open these cells
with the feverish impatience of a sorely-tried longing. All goes
well: they are half-full of fluid, dark, nauseating honey, with the
Bee's lately-hatched larva floating on the surface. This larva is
removed; and taking a thousand precautions, I lay one or more Sitares
on the surface of the honey. In other cells I leave the Bee's larva
and insert Sitares, placing them sometimes on the honey and sometimes
on the inner wall of the cell or simply at the entrance. Lastly, all
the cells thus prepared are put in glass tubes, which enable me to
observe them readily, without fear of disturbing my famished guests
at their meal.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Fabre, as a young man, was a master at Avignon College.
Cf. <i>The Life of the Fly:</i> chaps. xii., xiii., xix. and
xx.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>But what am I saying? Their meal? There is no meal! The Sitares,
placed at the entrance to a cell, far from seeking to <a name="page55"></a>make their way
in, leave it and go roaming about the glass tube; those which have
been placed on the inner surface of the cells, near the honey, emerge
precipitately, half-caught in the glue and tripping at every step;
lastly, those which I thought I had favoured the most, by placing
them on the honey itself, struggle, become entangled in the sticky
mass and perish in it, suffocated. Never did experiment break down so
completely! Larvæ, nymphs, cells, honey: I have offered you them all!
Then what do you want, you fiendish little creatures?</p>

<p>Tired of all these fruitless attempts, I ended where I ought to have
begun: I went to Carpentras. But it was too late: the Anthophora had
finished her work; and I did not succeed in seeing anything new.
During the course of the year I learnt from Léon Dufour,<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> to whom
I had spoken of the Sitares, that the tiny creature which he had
found on the Andrenæ<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> and described under <a name="page56"></a>the generic name of
Triungulinus, was recognized later by Newport<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> as the larva of a
Meloe, or Oil-beetle. Now it so happened that I had found a few
Oil-beetles in the cells of the same Anthophora that nourishes the
Sitares. Could there be a similarity of habits between the two kinds
of insects? This idea threw a sudden light for me upon the subject;
but I had plenty of time in which to mature my plans: I had another
year to wait.</p>

<p>When April came, my Sitaris-larvæ began, as usual, to bestir
themselves. The first Bee to appear, an Osmia, is dropped alive into
a glass jar containing a few of these larvæ; and after a lapse of
some fifteen minutes I inspect them through the pocket-lens. Five
Sitares are embedded in the fleece of the thorax. It is done, the
problem's solved! The larvæ of the Sitares, like those of the
Oil-beetles, cling like grim death to the fleece of their generous
host and make him carry them into the cell. Ten times over I repeat
the experiment with the various Bees that come to plunder the lilac
flowering outside my window and in particular with male <a name="page57"></a>Anthophoræ;
the result is still the same: the larvæ embed themselves in the hair
of the Bees' thorax. But after so many disappointments one becomes
distrustful and it is better to go and observe the facts upon the
spot; besides, the Easter holidays fall very conveniently and afford
me the leisure for my observations.</p>

<p>I will admit that my heart was beating a little faster than usual
when I found myself once again standing in front of the perpendicular
bank in which the Anthophora nests. What will be the result of the
experiment? Will it once more cover me with confusion? The weather is
cold and rainy; not a Bee shows herself on the few spring flowers
that have come out. Numbers of Anthophoræ cower, numbed and
motionless, at the entrance to the galleries. With the tweezers, I
extract them one by one from their lurking-places, to examine them
under the lens. The first has Sitaris-larvæ on her thorax; so has the
second; the third and fourth likewise; and so on, as far as I care to
pursue the examination. I change galleries ten times, twenty times;
the result is invariable. Then, for me, occurred one of the moments
which come to those who, after considering and reconsidering an idea
for years and years from <a name="page58"></a>every point of view, are at last able to
cry: "Eureka!"</p>

<p>On the days that followed, a serene and balmy sky enabled the
Anthophoræ to leave their retreats and scatter over the countryside
and despoil the flowers. I renewed my examination on those Anthophoræ
flying incessantly from one flower to another, whether in the
neighbourhood of the places where they were born or at great
distances from these places. Some were without Sitaris-larvæ; others,
more numerous, had two, three, four, five or more among the hairs of
their thorax. At Avignon, where I have not yet seen <i>Sitaris
humeralis</i>, the same species of Anthophora, observed at almost the
same season, while pillaging the lilac-blossom, was always free of
young Sitaris-grubs; at Carpentras, on the contrary, where there is
not a single Anthophora-colony without Sitares, nearly three-quarters
of the specimens which I examined carried a few of these larvæ in
their fleece.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, if we look for these larvæ in the
entrance-lobbies where we found them, a few days ago, piled up in
heaps, we no longer see them. Consequently, when the Anthophoræ,
having opened their cells, enter the galleries to <a name="page59"></a>reach the exit and
fly away, or else when the bad weather and the darkness bring them
back there for a time, the young Sitaris-larvæ, kept on the alert in
these same galleries by the stimulus of instinct, attach themselves
to the Bees, wriggling into their fur and clutching it so firmly that
they need not fear a fall during the long journeys of the insect
which carries them. By thus attaching themselves to the Anthophoræ
the young Sitares evidently intend to get themselves carried, at the
opportune moment, into the victualled cells.</p>

<p>One might even at first sight believe that they live for some time on
the Anthophora's body, just as the ordinary parasites, the various
species of Lice, live on the body of the animal that feeds them. But
not at all. The young Sitares, embedded in the fleece, at right
angles to the Anthophora's body, head inwards, rump outwards, do not
stir from the point which they have selected, a point near the Bee's
shoulders. We do not see them wandering from spot to spot, exploring
the Anthophora's body, seeking the part where the skin is more
delicate, as they would certainly do if they were really deriving
some nourishment from the juices of the Bee. On the contrary, they
are nearly <a name="page60"></a>always established on the toughest and hardest part of the
Bee's body, on the thorax, a little below the insertion of the wings,
or, more rarely, on the head; and they remain absolutely motionless,
fixed to the same hair, by means of the mandibles, the feet, the
closed crescent of the eighth segment and, lastly, the glue of the
anal button. If they chance to be disturbed in this position, they
reluctantly repair to another point of the thorax, pushing their way
through the insect's fur and in the end fastening on to another hair,
as before.</p>

<p>To confirm my conviction that the young Sitaris-grubs do not feed on
the Anthophora's body, I have sometimes placed within their reach, in
a glass jar, some Bees that have long been dead and are completely
dried up. On these dry corpses, fit at most for gnawing, but
certainly containing nothing to suck, the Sitaris-larvæ took up their
customary position and there remained motionless as on the living
insect. They obtain nothing, therefore, from the Anthophora's body;
but perhaps they nibble her fleece, even as the Bird-lice nibble the
birds' feathers?</p>

<p>To do this, they would require mouth-parts endowed with a certain
strength and, in particular, horny and sturdy jaws, whereas <a name="page61"></a>their
jaws are so fine that a microscopic examination failed to show them
to me. The larvæ, it is true, are provided with powerful mandibles;
but these finely-pointed mandibles, with their backward curve, though
excellent for tugging at food and tearing it to pieces, are useless
for grinding it or gnawing it. Lastly, we have a final proof of the
passive condition of the Sitaris-larvæ on the body of the Anthophoræ
in the fact that the Bees do not appear to be in any way incommoded
by their presence, since we do not see them trying to rid themselves
of the grubs. Some Anthophoræ which were free from these grubs and
some others which were carrying five or six upon their bodies were
placed separately in glass jars. When the first disturbance resulting
from their captivity was appeased, I could see nothing peculiar about
those occupied by the young Sitares. And, if all these arguments were
not sufficient, I might add that a creature which has already been
able to spend seven months without food and which in a few days' time
will proceed to drink a highly-flavoured fluid would be guilty of a
singular inconsistency if it were to start nibbling the dry fleece of
a Bee. It therefore seems to me undeniable that the young Sitares
settle on the Anthophora's body <a name="page62"></a>merely to make her carry them into
the cells which she will soon be building.</p>

<p>But until then the future parasites must hold tight to the fleece of
their hostess, despite her rapid evolutions among the flowers,
despite her rubbing against the walls of the galleries when she
enters to take shelter and, above all, despite the brushing which she
must often give herself with her feet to dust herself and keep spick
and span. Hence no doubt the need for that curious apparatus which no
standing or moving upon ordinary surfaces could explain, as was said
above, when we were wondering what the shifting, swaying, dangerous
body might be on which the larva would have to establish itself
later. This body is a hair of a Bee who makes a thousand rapid
journeys, now diving into her narrow galleries, now forcing her way
down the tight throat of a corolla, and who never rests except to
brush herself with her feet and remove the specks of dust collected
by the down which covers her.</p>

<p>We can now easily understand the use of the projecting crescent whose
two horns, by closing together, are able to take hold of a hair more
easily than the most delicate tweezers; we perceive the full value of
the tenacious adhesive provided by the anus to <a name="page63"></a>save the tiny
creature, at the least sign of danger, from an imminent fall; we
realize lastly the useful function that may be fulfilled by the
elastic cirri of the flanks and legs, which are an absolute and most
embarrassing superfluity when walking upon a smooth surface, but
which, in the present case, penetrate like so many probes into the
thickness of the Anthophora's down and serve as it were to anchor the
Sitaris-larva in position. The more we consider this arrangement,
which seems modelled by a blind caprice so long as the grub drags
itself laboriously over a smooth surface, the more do we marvel at
the means, as effective as they are varied, which are lavished upon
this fragile creature to help it to preserve its unstable
equilibrium.</p>

<p>Before I describe what becomes of the Sitaris-grubs on leaving the
body of the Anthophoræ, I must not omit to mention one very
remarkable peculiarity. All the Bees invaded by these grubs that have
hitherto been observed have, without one exception, been male
Anthophoræ. Those whom I drew from their lurking-places were males;
those whom I caught upon the flowers were males; and, in spite of the
most active search, I failed to find a single female at liberty. <a name="page64"></a>The
cause of this total absence of females is easy to understand.</p>

<p>If we remove a few clods from the area occupied by the nests, we see
that, though all the males have already opened and abandoned their
cells, the females, on the contrary, are still enclosed in theirs,
but on the point of soon taking flight. This appearance of the males
almost a month before the emergence of the females is not peculiar to
the Anthophoræ; I have observed it in many other Bees and
particularly in the Three-horned Osmia (<i>O. tricornis</i>), who inhabits
the same site as the Hairy-footed Anthophora (<i>A. pilipes</i>). The
males of the Osmia make their appearance even before those of the
Anthophora and at so early a season that the young Sitaris-larvæ are
perhaps not yet aroused by the instinctive impulse which urges them
to activity. It is no doubt to their precocious awakening that the
males of the Osmia owe their ability to traverse with impunity the
corridors in which the young Sitaris-grubs are heaped together,
without having the latter fasten to their fleece; at least, I cannot
otherwise explain the absence of these larvæ from the backs of the
male Osmiæ, since, when we place them artificially in the presence of
these <a name="page65"></a>Bees, they fasten on them as readily as on the Anthophoræ.</p>

<p>The emergence from the common site begun by the male Osmiæ is
continued by the male Anthophoræ and ends with the almost
simultaneous emergence of the female Osmiæ and Anthophoræ. I was
easily able to verify this sequence by observing at my own place, in
the early spring, the dates at which the cells, collected during the
previous autumn, were broken.</p>

<p>At the moment of their emergence, the male Anthophoræ, passing
through the galleries in which the Sitaris-larvæ are waiting on the
alert, must pick up a certain number of them; and those among them
who, by entering empty corridors, escape the enemy on this first
occasion will not evade him for long, for the rain, the chilly air
and the darkness bring them back to their former homes, where they
take shelter now in one gallery, now in another, during a great part
of April. This constant traffic of the males in the entrance-lobbies
of their houses and the prolonged stay which the bad weather often
compels them to make provide the Sitares with the most favourable
opportunity for slipping into the Bees' fur and taking up their
position. Moreover, when this state of <a name="page66"></a>affairs has lasted a month or
so, there can be only very few if any larvæ left wandering about
without having attained their end. At that period I was unable to
find them anywhere save on the body of the male Anthophora.</p>

<p>It is therefore extremely probable that, on their emergence, which
takes place as May draws near, the female Anthophoræ do not pick up
Sitaris-larvæ in the corridors, or pick up only a number which will
not compare with that carried by the males. In fact, the first
females that I was able to observe in April, in the actual
neighbourhood of the nests, were free from these larvæ. Nevertheless
it is upon the females that the Sitaris-larvæ must finally establish
themselves, for the males upon whom they now are cannot introduce
them into the cells, since they take no part in the building or
provisioning. There is therefore, at a given moment, a transfer of
Sitaris-larvæ from the male Anthophoræ to the females; and this
transfer is, beyond a doubt, effected during the union of the sexes.
The female finds in the male's embraces both life and death for her
offspring; at the moment when she surrenders herself to the male for
the preservation of her race, the vigilant parasites pass from the
<a name="page67"></a>male to the female, with the extermination of that same race in view.</p>

<p>In support of these deductions, here is a fairly conclusive
experiment, though it reproduces the natural circumstances but
roughly. On a female taken in her cell and therefore free from
Sitares, I place a male who is infested with them; and I keep the two
sexes in contact, suppressing their unruly movements as far as I am
able. After fifteen or twenty minutes of this enforced proximity, the
female is invaded by one or more of the larvæ which at first were on
the male. True, experiment does not always succeed under these
imperfect conditions.</p>

<p>By watching at Avignon the few Anthophoræ that I succeeded in
discovering, I was able to detect the precise moment of their work;
and on the following Thursday,<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small> the 21st of May, I repaired in all
haste to Carpentras, to witness, if possible, the entrance of the
Sitares into the Bee's cells. I was not mistaken: the works were in
full swing.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> Thursday is the weekly holiday in French
schools.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>In front of a high expanse of earth, a swarm stimulated by the sun,
which floods it with light and heat, is dancing a crazy <a name="page68"></a>ballet. It is
a hover of Anthophoræ, a few feet thick and covering an area which
matches the sort of house-front formed by the perpendicular soil.
From the tumultuous heart of the cloud rises a monotonous,
threatening murmur, while the bewildered eye strays through the
inextricable evolutions of the eager throng. With the rapidity of a
lightning-flash thousands of Anthophoræ are incessantly flying off
and scattering over the country-side in search of booty; thousands of
others also are incessantly arriving, laden with honey or mortar, and
keeping up the formidable proportions of the swarm.</p>

<p>I was at that time something of a novice as regards the nature of
these insects:</p>

<p>"Woe," said I to myself, "woe to the reckless wight bold enough to
enter the heart of this swarm and, above all, to lay a rash hand upon
the dwellings under construction! Forthwith surrounded by the furious
host, he would expiate his rash attempt, stabbed by a thousand
stings!"</p>

<p>At this thought, rendered still more alarming by the recollection of
certain misadventures of which I had been the victim when seeking to
observe too closely the combs of the Hornet (<i>Vespa crabro</i>), I felt
a shiver of apprehension pass through my body.</p>
<a name="page69"></a>
<p>Yet, to obtain light upon the question which brings me hither, I must
needs penetrate the fearsome swarm; I must stand for whole hours,
perhaps all day, watching the works which I intend to upset; lens in
hand, I must scrutinize, unmoved amid the whirl, the things that are
happening in the cells. The use moreover of a mask, of gloves, of a
covering of any kind is impracticable, for utter dexterity of the
fingers and complete liberty of sight are essential to the
investigations which I have to make. No matter: even though I leave
this wasps'-nest with a face swollen beyond recognition, I must
to-day obtain a decisive solution of the problem which has
preoccupied me too long.</p>

<p>A few strokes of the net, aimed, beyond the limits of the swarm, at
the Anthophoræ on their way to the harvest or returning, soon
informed me that the Sitaris-larvæ are perched on the thorax, as I
expected, occupying the same position as on the males. The
circumstances therefore could not be more favourable. We will inspect
the cells without further delay.</p>

<p>My preparations are made at once: I button my clothes tightly, so as
to afford the Bees the least possible opportunity, and I enter the
heart of the swarm. A few blows of <a name="page70"></a>the mattock, which arouse a far
from reassuring crescendo in the humming of the Anthophoræ, soon
place me in possession of a lump of earth; and I beat a hasty
retreat, greatly astonished to find myself still safe and sound and
unpursued. But the lump of earth which I have removed is from a part
too near the surface; it contains nothing but Osmia-cells, which do
not interest me for the moment. A second expedition is made, lasting
longer than the first; and, though my retreat is effected without
great precipitation, not an Anthophora has touched me with her sting,
nor even shown herself disposed to fall upon the aggressor.</p>

<p>This success emboldens me. I remain permanently in front of the work
in progress, continually removing lumps of earth filled with cells,
spilling the liquid honey on the ground, eviscerating larvæ and
crushing the Bees busily occupied in their nests. All this
devastation results merely in arousing a louder hum in the swarm and
is not followed by any hostile demonstration. The Anthophoræ whose
cells are not hurt go about their labours as if nothing unusual were
happening round about them; those whose dwellings are overturned try
to repair them, or hover distractedly in front of the <a name="page71"></a>ruins; but none
of them seems inclined to swoop down upon the author of the damage.
At most, a few, more irritated than the rest, come at intervals and
hover before my face, confronting me at a distance of a couple of
inches, and then fly away, after a few moments of this curious
inspection.</p>

<p>Despite the selection of a common site for their nests, which might
suggest an attempt at communistic interests among the Anthophoræ,
these Bees, therefore, obey the egotistical law of each one for
himself and do not know how to band themselves together to repel an
enemy who threatens one and all. Taken singly, the Anthophora does
not even know how to dash at the enemy who is ravaging her cells and
drive him away with her stings; the pacific creature hastily leaves
its dwelling when disturbed by undermining and escapes in a crippled
state, sometimes even mortally wounded, without thinking of making
use of its venomous sting, except when it is seized and handled. Many
other Hymenoptera, honey-gatherers or hunters, are quite as
spiritless; and I can assert to-day, after a long experience, that
only the Social Hymenoptera, the Hive-bees, the Common Wasps and the
Bumble-bees, know how to devise a common defence; and only they dare
<a name="page72"></a>fall singly upon the aggressor, to wreak an individual vengeance.</p>

<p>Thanks to this unexpected lack of spirit in the Mason-bee, I was able
for hours to pursue my investigations at my leisure, seated on a
stone in the midst of the murmuring and distracted swarm, without
receiving a single sting, though I took no precautions whatever.
Country-folk, happening to pass and beholding me seated, unperturbed,
in the midst of the whirl of Bees, stopped aghast to ask me whether I
had bewitched them, whether I charmed them, since I appeared to have
nothing to fear from them:</p>

<p><i>"Mé, moun bel ami, li-z-avé doun escounjurado què vous pougnioun pas,
canèu de sort!"</i></p>

<p>My miscellaneous impedimenta spread over the ground, boxes, glass
jars and tubes, tweezers and magnifying-glasses, were certainly
regarded by these good people as the implements of my wizardry.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to examine the cells. Some are still open and
contain only a more or less complete store of honey. Others are
hermetically sealed with an earthen lid. The contents of these latter
vary greatly. Sometimes we find the larva of a Bee which has finished
its mess or is on the point of <a name="page73"></a>finishing it; sometimes a larva, white
like the first, but more corpulent and of a different shape; at other
times honey with an egg floating on the surface. The honey is liquid
and sticky, with a brownish colour and a very strong, repulsive
smell. The egg is of a beautiful white, cylindrical in shape,
slightly curved into an arc, a fifth or a sixth of an inch in length
and not quite a twenty-fifth of an inch in thickness; it is the egg
of the Anthophora.</p>

<p>In a few cells this egg is floating all alone on the surface of the
honey; in others, very numerous these, we see, lying on the egg of
the Anthophora, as on a sort of raft, a young Sitaris-grub with the
shape and the dimensions which I have described above, that is to
say, with the shape and the dimensions which the creature possesses
on leaving the egg. This is the enemy within the gates.</p>

<p>When and how did it get in? In none of the cells where I have
observed it was I able to distinguish a fissure which could have
allowed it to enter; they are all sealed in a quite irreproachable
manner. The parasite therefore established itself in the
honey-warehouse before the warehouse was closed; on the other hand,
the open cells, full of honey, but as yet without the egg of the
<a name="page74"></a>Anthophora, are always free from parasites. It is therefore during
the laying, or afterwards, when the Anthophora is occupied in
plastering the door of the cell, that the young larva gains
admittance. It is impossible to decide by experiment to which of
these two periods we must ascribe the introduction of the Sitares
into the cell; for, however peaceable the Anthophora may be, it is
evident that we cannot hope to witness what happens in the cell at
the moment when she is laying an egg or at the moment when she is
making the lid. But a few attempts will soon convince us that the
only second which would allow the Sitaris to establish itself in the
home of the Bee is the very second when the egg is laid on the
surface of the honey.</p>

<p>Let us take an Anthophora-cell full of honey and furnished with an
egg and, after removing the lid, place it in a glass tube with a few
Sitaris-grubs. The grubs do not appear at all eager for this wealth
of nectar placed within their reach; they wander at random about the
tube, run about the outside of the cell, sometimes happen upon the
edge of the orifice and very rarely venture inside. When they do,
they do not go far in and they come out again at once. If one happens
to reach the honey, which only half fills the <a name="page75"></a>cell, it tries to
escape as soon as it has perceived the shifting nature of the sticky
soil upon which it was about to enter; but, tottering at every step,
because of the viscous matter clinging to its feet, it often ends by
falling back into the honey, where it dies of suffocation.</p>

<p>Again, we may experiment as follows: having prepared a cell as
before, we place a larva most carefully on its inner wall, or else on
the surface of the food itself. In the first case, the larva hastens
to leave the cell; in the second case, it struggles awhile on the
surface of the honey and ends by getting so completely caught that,
after a thousand efforts to gain the shore, it is swallowed up in the
viscous lake.</p>

<p>In short, all attempts to establish the Sitaris-grub in an
Anthophora-cell provisioned with honey and furnished with an egg are
no more successful than those which I made with cells whose store of
food had already been broached by the larva of the Bee, as described
above. It is therefore certain that the Sitaris-grub does not leave
the fleece of the Mason-bee when the Bee is in her cell or at the
entrance to it, in order itself to make a rush for the coveted honey;
for this honey would inevitably cause its <a name="page76"></a>death, if it happened by
accident to touch the perilous surface merely with the tip of its
tarsi.</p>

<p>Since we cannot admit that the Sitaris-grub leaves the furry corselet
of its hostess to slip unseen into the cell, whose orifice is not yet
wholly walled up, at the moment when the Anthophora is building her
door, all that remains to investigate is the second at which the egg
is being laid. Remember in the first place that the young Sitaris
which we find in a closed cell is always placed on the egg of the
Bee. We shall see in a minute that this egg not merely serves as a
raft for the tiny creature floating on a very treacherous lake, but
also constitutes the first and indispensable part of its diet. To get
at this egg, situated in the centre of the lake of honey, to reach,
at all costs, this raft, which is also its first ration, the young
larva evidently possesses some means of avoiding the fatal contact of
the honey; and this means can be provided only by the actions of the
Bee herself.</p>

<p>In the second place, observations repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> have shown me
that at no period do we find in each invaded cell more than a single
Sitaris, in one or other of the forms which it successively assumes.
Yet there are several young larvæ established in <a name="page77"></a>the silky tangle of
the Bee's thorax, all eagerly watching for the propitious moment at
which to enter the dwelling in which they are to continue their
development. How then does it happen that these larvæ, goaded by such
an appetite as one would expect after seven or eight months' complete
abstinence, instead of all rushing together into the first cell
within reach, on the contrary enter the various cells which the Bee
is provisioning one at a time and in perfect order? Some action must
take place here independent of the Sitares.</p>

<p>To satisfy those two indispensable conditions, the arrival of the
larva upon the egg without crossing the honey and the introduction of
a single larva among all those waiting in the fleece of the Bee,
there can be only one explanation, which is to suppose that, at the
moment when the Anthophora's egg is half out of the oviduct, one of
the Sitares which have hastened from the thorax to the tip of the
abdomen, one more highly favoured by its position, instantly settles
upon the egg, a bridge too narrow for two, and with it reaches the
surface of the honey. The impossibility of otherwise fulfilling the
two conditions which I have stated gives to the explanation which I
am offering a degree <a name="page78"></a>of certainty almost equivalent to that which
would be furnished by direct observation, which is here,
unfortunately, impracticable. This presupposes, it is true, in the
microscopic little creature destined to live in a place where so many
dangers threaten it from the first, an astonishingly rational
inspiration, which adapts the means to the end with amazing logic.
But is not this the invariable conclusion to which the study of
instinct always leads us?</p>

<p>When dropping her egg upon the honey, therefore, the Anthophora at
the same time deposits in her cell the mortal enemy of her race; she
carefully plasters the lid which closes the entrance to the cell; and
all is done. A second cell is built beside it, probably to suffer the
same fatal doom; and so on until the more or less numerous parasites
sheltered by her down are all accommodated. Let us leave the unhappy
mother to continue her fruitless task and turn our attention to the
young larva which has so adroitly secured itself board and lodging.</p>

<p>In opening cells whose lid is still moist, we end by discovering one
in which the egg, recently laid, supports a young Sitaris. This egg
is intact and in irreproachable condition. But now the work of
devastation begins: the <a name="page79"></a>larva, a tiny black speck which we see
running over the white surface of the egg, at last stops and balances
itself firmly on its six legs; then, seizing the delicate skin of the
egg with the sharp hooks of its mandibles, it tugs at it violently
until it breaks, spilling its contents, which the larva eagerly
drinks up. Thus the first stroke of the mandibles which the parasite
delivers in the usurped cell is aimed at the destruction of the Bee's
egg. A highly logical precaution! The Sitaris-larva, as we shall see,
has to feed upon the honey in the cell; the Anthophora-larva which
would proceed from that egg would require the same food; but the
portion is too small for two; so, quick, a bite at the egg and the
difficulty will be removed. The story of these facts calls for no
comment. This destruction of the cumbersome egg is all the more
inevitable inasmuch as special tastes compel the young Sitaris-grub
to make its first meals of it. Indeed we see the tiny creature begin
by greedily drinking the juices which the torn wrapper of the egg
allows to escape; and for several days it may be observed, at one
time motionless on this envelope, in which it rummages at intervals
with its head, at others running over it from end to end to rip it
open still wider and to <a name="page80"></a>cause a little of the juices, which become
daily less abundant, to trickle from it; but we never catch it
imbibing the honey which surrounds it on every side.</p>

<p>For that matter, it is easy to convince ourselves that the egg
combines with the function of a life-buoy that of the first ration. I
have laid on the surface of the honey in a cell a tiny strip of
paper, of the same dimensions as the egg; and on this raft I have
placed a Sitaris-larva. Despite every care, my attempts, many times
repeated, always failed. The larva, placed in a paper boat in the
centre of the mass of honey, behaves as in the earlier experiments.
Not finding what suits it, it tries to escape and perishes in the
sticky toils as soon as it leaves the strip of paper, which it soon
does.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we can easily rear Sitaris-grubs by taking
Anthophora-cells not invaded by the parasites, cells in which the egg
is not yet hatched. All that we have to do is to pick up one of these
grubs with the moistened tip of a needle and to lay it delicately on
the egg. There is then no longer the least attempt to escape. After
exploring the egg to find its way about, the larva rips it open and
for several days does <a name="page81"></a>not stir from the spot. Henceforth its
development takes place unhindered, provided that the cell be
protected from too rapid evaporation, which would dry up the honey
and render it unfit for the grub's food. The Anthophora's egg
therefore is absolutely necessary to the Sitaris-larva, not merely as
a boat, but also as its first nourishment. This is the whole secret,
for lack of knowing which I had hitherto failed in my attempts to
rear the larvæ hatched in my glass jars.</p>

<p>At the end of a week, the egg, drained by the parasite, is nothing
but a dry skin. The first meal is finished. The Sitaris-larva, whose
dimensions have almost doubled, now splits open along the back; and
through a slit which comprises the head and the three thoracic
segments a white corpusculum, the second form of this singular
organism, escapes to fall on the surface of the honey, while the
abandoned slough remains clinging to the raft which has hitherto
safeguarded and fed the larva. Presently both sloughs, those of the
Sitaris and the egg, will disappear, submerged under the waves of
honey which the new larva is about to raise. Here ends the history of
the first form adopted by the Sitaris.</p>
<a name="page82"></a>
<p>In summing up the above, we see that the strange little creature
awaits, without food, for seven months, the appearance of the
Anthophoræ and at last fastens on to the hairs on the corselet of the
males, who are the first to emerge and who inevitably pass within its
reach in going through their corridors. From the fleece of the male
the larva moves, three or four weeks later, to that of the female, at
the moment of coupling; and then from the female to the egg leaving
the oviduct. It is by this concatenation of complex manoeuvres that
the larva in the end finds itself perched upon an egg in the middle
of a closed cell filled with honey. These perilous gymnastics on the
hair of a Bee in movement all the day, this passing from one sex to
the other, this arrival in the middle of the cell by way of the egg,
a dangerous bridge thrown across the sticky abyss, all this
necessitates the balancing-appliances with which it is provided and
which I have described above. Lastly, the destruction of the egg
calls, in its turn, for a sharp pair of scissors; and such is the
object of the keen, curved mandibles. Thus the primary form of the
Sitares has as its function to get itself carried by the Anthophora
into the cell and to rip up her egg. This <a name="page83"></a>done, the organism becomes
transformed to such a degree that repeated observations are required
to make us believe the evidence of our eyes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<center>THE PRIMARY LARVA OF THE OIL-BEETLES</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>I interrupt the history of the Sitares to speak of the Meloes, those
uncouth Beetles, with their clumsy belly and their limp wing-cases
yawning over their back like the tails of a fat man's coat that is
far too tight for its wearer. The insect is ugly in colouring, which
is black, with an occasional blue gleam, and uglier still in shape
and gait; and its disgusting method of defence increases the
repugnance with which it inspires us. If it judges itself to be in
danger, the Meloe resorts to spontaneous bleeding. From its joints a
yellowish, oily fluid oozes, which stains your fingers and makes them
stink. This is the creature's blood. The English, because of its
trick of discharging oily blood when on the defensive, call this
insect the Oil-beetle. It would not be a particularly interesting
Beetle save for its metamorphoses and the peregrinations of its
larva, which are similar in every respect to those of the larva of
the Sitares. In their first form, the Oil-beetles are parasites of
the Anthophoræ; <a name="page85"></a>their tiny grub, when it leaves the egg, has itself
carried into the cell by the Bee whose victuals are to form its food.</p>

<p>Observed in the down of various Bees, the queer little creature for a
long time baffled the sagacity of the naturalists, who, mistaking its
true origin, made it a species of a special family of wingless
insects. It was the Bee-louse (<i>Pediculus apis</i>) of Linnæus;<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> the
Triungulin of the Andrenæ (<i>Triungulinus andrenetarum</i>) of Léon
Dufour. They saw in it a parasite, a sort of Louse, living in the
fleece of the honey-gatherers. It was reserved for the distinguished
English naturalist Newport to show that this supposed Louse was the
first state of the Oil-beetles. Some observations of my own will fill
a few lacunæ in the English scientist's monograph. I will therefore
sketch the evolution of the Oil-beetles, using Newport's work where
my own observations are defective. In this way the Sitares and the
Meloes, alike in habits and transformations, will be compared; and
the comparison will throw a certain light upon the strange
metamorphoses of these insects.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Carolus Linnæus (Karl von Linné, 1707-1778), the
celebrated Swedish botanist and naturalist, founder of the Linnæan
system of classification.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>
<a name="page86"></a>
<p>The same Mason-bee (<i>Anthophora pilipes</i>) upon whom the Sitares live
also feeds a few scarce Meloes (<i>M. cicatricosus</i>) in its cells. A
second Anthophora of my district (<i>A. parietina</i>) is more subject to
this parasite's invasions. It was also in the nests of an Anthophora,
but of a different species (<i>A. retusa</i>), that Newport observed the
same Oil-beetle. These three lodgings adopted by <i>Meloe cicatricosus</i>
may be of some slight interest, as leading us to suspect that each
species of Meloe is apparently the parasite of diverse Bees, a
suspicion which will be confirmed when we examine the manner in which
the larvæ reach the cell full of honey. The Sitares, though less
given to change of lodging, are likewise able to inhabit nests of
different species. They are very common in the cells of <i>Anthophora
pilipes;</i> but I have found them also, in very small numbers, it is
true, in the cells of <i>A. personata</i>.</p>

<p>Despite the presence of <i>Meloe cicatricosus</i> in the dwellings of the
Mason-bee, which I so often ransacked in compiling the history of the
Sitares, I never saw this insect, at any season of the year,
wandering on the perpendicular soil, at the entrance of the
corridors, for the purpose of laying its eggs <a name="page87"></a>there, as the Sitares
do; and I should know nothing of the details of the egg-laying if
Godart,<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> de Geer<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> and, above all, Newport had not informed us
that the Oil-beetles lay their eggs in the earth. According to the
last-named author, the various Oil-beetles whom he had the
opportunity of observing dig, among the roots of a clump of grass, in
a dry soil exposed to the sun, a hole a couple of inches deep which
they carefully fill up after laying their eggs there in a heap. This
laying is repeated three or four times over, at intervals of a few
days during the same season. For each batch of eggs the female digs a
special hole, which she does not fail to fill up afterwards. This
takes place in April and May.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> Jean Baptiste Godart (1775-1823), the principal editor
of <i>L'Histoire naturelle des lépidoptères de France</i>.&mdash;<i>Translator's
Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> Baron Karl de Geer (1720-1778), the Swedish
entomologist, author of <i>Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des
insectes</i> (1752-1778).&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The number of eggs laid in a single batch is really prodigious. In
the first batch, which, it is true, is the most prolific of all,
<i>Meloe proscarabæus</i>, according to Newport's calculations, produces
the astonishing number of 4,218 eggs, which is double the number of
eggs laid by a Sitaris. And what <a name="page88"></a>must the number be, when we allow
for the two or three batches that follow the first! The Sitares,
entrusting their eggs to the very corridors through which the
Anthophora is bound to pass, spare their larvæ a host of dangers
which the larvæ of the Meloe have to run, for these, born far from
the dwellings of the Bees, are obliged to make their own way to their
hymenopterous foster-parents. The Oil-beetles, therefore, lacking the
instinct of the Sitares, are endowed with incomparably greater
fecundity. The richness of their ovaries atones for the insufficiency
of instinct by proportioning the number of germs in accordance with
the risks of destruction. What transcendent harmony is this, which
thus holds the scales between the fecundity of the ovaries and the
perfection of instinct!</p>

<p>The hatching of the eggs takes place at the end of May or in June,
about a month after they are laid. The eggs of the Sitares also are
hatched after the same lapse of time. But the Meloe-larvæ, more
greatly favoured, are able to set off immediately in search of the
Bees that are to feed them; while those of the Sitares, hatched in
September, have to wait motionless and in complete abstinence for the
emergence of the <a name="page89"></a>Anthophoræ the entrance to whose cells they guard. I
will not describe the young Meloe-larva, which is sufficiently well
known, in particular by the description and the diagram furnished by
Newport. To enable the reader to understand what follows, I will
confine myself to stating that this primary larva is a sort of little
yellow louse, long and slender, found in the spring in the down of
different Bees.</p>

<p>How has this tiny creature made its way from the underground lodging
where the eggs are hatched to the fleece of a Bee? Newport suspects
that the young Oil-beetles, on emerging from their natal burrow,
climb upon the neighbouring plants, especially upon the Cichoriceæ,
and wait, concealed among the petals, until a few Bees chance to
plunder the flower, when they promptly fasten on to their fur and
allow themselves to be borne away by them. I have more than Newport's
suspicions upon this curious point; my personal observations and
experiments are absolutely convincing. I will relate them as the
first phase of the history of the Bee-louse. They date back to the
23rd of May, 1858.</p>

<p>A vertical bank on the road from Carpentras to Bédoin is this time
the scene of <a name="page90"></a>my observations. This bank, baked by the sun, is
exploited by numerous swarms of Anthophoræ, who, more industrious
than their congeners, are in the habit of building, at the entrance
to their corridors, with serpentine fillets of earth, a vestibule, a
defensive bastion in the form of an arched cylinder. In a word, they
are swarms of <i>A. parietina</i>. A sparse carpet of turf extends from
the edge of the road to the foot of the bank. The more comfortably to
follow the work of the Bees, in the hope of wresting some secret from
them, I had been lying for a few moments upon this turf, in the very
heart of the inoffensive swarm, when my clothes were invaded by
legions of little yellow lice, running with desperate eagerness
through the hairy thickets of the nap of the cloth. In these tiny
creatures, with which I was powdered here and there as with yellow
dust, I soon recognized an old acquaintance, the young Oil-beetles,
whom I now saw for the first time elsewhere than in the Bees' fur or
the interior of their cells. I could not lose so excellent an
opportunity of learning how these larvæ manage to establish
themselves upon the bodies of their foster-parents.</p>

<p>In the grass where, after lying down for a moment, I had caught these
lice were a <a name="page91"></a>few plants in blossom, of which the most abundant were
three composites: <i>Hedypnois polymorpha</i>, <i>Senecio gallicus</i> and
<i>Anthemis arvensis</i>. Now it was on a composite, a dandelion, that
Newport seemed to remember seeing some young Oil-beetles; and my
attention therefore was first of all directed to the plants which I
have named. To my great satisfaction, nearly all the flowers of these
three plants, especially those of the camomile (<i>Anthemis</i>) were
occupied by young Oil-beetles in greater or lesser numbers. On one
head of camomile I counted forty of these tiny insects, cowering
motionless in the centre of the florets. On the other hand, I could
not discover any on the flowers of the poppy or of a wild rocket
(<i>Diplotaxis muralis</i>) which grew promiscuously among the plants
aforesaid. It seems to me, therefore, that it is only on the
composite flowers that the Meloe-larvæ await the Bees' arrival.</p>

<p>In addition to this population encamped upon the heads of the
composites and remaining motionless, as though it had achieved its
object for the moment, I soon discovered yet another, far more
numerous, whose anxious activity betrayed a fruitless search. On the
ground, in the grass, numberless little <a name="page92"></a>larvæ were running in a great
flutter, recalling in some respects the tumultuous disorder of an
overturned Ant-hill; others were hurriedly climbing to the tip of a
blade of grass and descending with the same haste; others again were
plunging into the downy fluff of the withered everlastings, remaining
there a moment and quickly reappearing to continue their search.
Lastly, with a little attention, I was able to convince myself that
within an area of a dozen square yards there was perhaps not a single
blade of grass which was not explored by several of these larvæ.</p>

<p>I was evidently witnessing the recent emergence of the young
Oil-beetles from their maternal lairs. Part of them had already
settled on the groundsel- and camomile-flowers to await the arrival
of the Bees; but the majority were still wandering in search of this
provisional refuge. It was by this wandering population that I had
been invaded when I lay down at the foot of the bank. It was
impossible that all these larvæ, the tale of whose alarming thousands
I would not venture to define, should form one family and recognize a
common mother; despite what Newport has told us of the Oil-beetles'
astonishing fecundity, I could not believe this, so great was their
multitude.</p>
<a name="page93"></a>
<p>Though the green carpet was continued for a considerable distance
along the side of the road, I could not detect a single Meloe-larva
elsewhere than in the few square yards lying in front of the bank
inhabited by the Mason-bee. These larvæ therefore could not have come
far; to find themselves near the Anthophoræ they had had no long
pilgrimage to make, for there was not a sign of the inevitable
stragglers and laggards that follow in the wake of a travelling
caravan. The burrows in which the eggs were hatched were therefore in
that turf opposite the Bees' abode. Thus the Oil-beetles, far from
laying their eggs at random, as their wandering life might lead one
to suppose, and leaving their young to the task of approaching their
future home, are able to recognize the spots haunted by the
Anthophoræ and lay their eggs in the near neighbourhood of those
spots.</p>

<p>With such a multitude of parasites occupying the composite flowers in
close proximity to the Anthophora's nests, it is impossible that the
majority of the swarm should not become infested sooner or later. At
the time of my observations, a comparatively tiny proportion of the
starving legion was waiting on the flowers; the others were still
<a name="page94"></a>wandering on the ground, where the Anthophoræ very rarely alight; and
yet I detected the presence of several Meloe-larvæ in the thoracic
down of nearly all the Anthophoræ which I caught and examined.</p>

<p>I have also found them on the bodies of the Melecta- and
Coelioxys-bees,<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> who are parasitic on the Anthophoræ. Suspending
their audacious patrolling before the galleries under construction,
these spoilers of the victualled cells alight for an instant on a
camomile-flower and lo, the thief is robbed! A tiny, imperceptible
louse has slipped into the thick of the downy fur and, at the moment
when the parasite, after destroying the Anthophora's egg, is laying
her own upon the stolen honey, will creep upon this egg, destroy it
in its turn and remain sole mistress of the provisions. The mess of
honey amassed by the Anthophora will thus pass through the hands of
three owners and remain finally the property of the weakest of the
three.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Mason-bees:</i> chaps. viii. and
ix.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>And who shall say whether the Meloe, in its turn, will not be
dispossessed by a fresh thief; or even whether it will not, in the
state of a drowsy, fat and flabby larva, fall a <a name="page95"></a>prey to some marauder
who will munch its live entrails? As we meditate upon this deadly,
implacable struggle which nature imposes, for their preservation, on
these different creatures, which are by turns possessors and
dispossessed, devourers and devoured, a painful impression mingles
with the wonder aroused by the means employed by each parasite to
attain its end; and, forgetting for a moment the tiny world in which
these things happen, we are seized with terror at this concatenation
of larceny, cunning and brigandage which forms part, alas, of the
designs of <i>alma parens rerum!</i></p>

<p>The young Meloe-larvæ established in the down of the Anthophoræ or in
that of the Melecta- and the Coelioxys-bees, their parasites, had
adopted an infallible means of sooner or later reaching the desired
cell. Was it, so far as they were concerned, a choice dictated by the
foresight of instinct, or just simply the result of a lucky chance?
The question was soon decided. Various Flies&mdash;Drone-flies and
Bluebottles (<i>Eristalis tenax</i> and <i>Calliphora vomitoria</i>)&mdash;would
settle from time to time on the groundsel- or camomile-flowers
occupied by the young Meloes and stop for a moment to suck the sweet
secretions. On all these Flies, <a name="page96"></a>with very few exceptions, I found
Meloe-larvæ, motionless in the silky down of the thorax. I may also
mention, as infested by these larvæ, an Ammophila (<i>A. hirsuta</i>),<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small>
who victuals her burrows with a caterpillar in early spring, while
her kinswomen build their nests in autumn. This Wasp merely grazes,
so to speak, the surface of a flower; I catch her; there are Meloes
moving about her body. It is clear that neither the Drone-flies nor
the Bluebottles, whose larvæ live in putrefying matter, nor yet the
Ammophilæ who victual theirs with caterpillars, could ever have
carried the larvæ which invaded them into cells filled with honey.
These larvæ therefore had gone astray; and instinct, as does not
often happen, was here at fault.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> For the Wasp known as the Hairy Ammophila, who feeds her
young on the Grey Worm, the caterpillar of the Turnip Moth, cf. <i>The
Hunting Wasps</i>, chaps. xviii. to xx.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the young Meloes waiting expectant
upon the camomile-flowers. There they are, ten, fifteen or more,
lodged half-way down the florets of a single blossom or in their
interstices; it therefore needs a certain degree of scrutiny to
perceive them, their hiding-place being the <a name="page97"></a>more effectual in that
the amber colour of their bodies merges in the yellow hue of the
florets. So long as nothing unusual happens upon the flower, so long
as no sudden shock announces the arrival of a strange visitor, the
Meloes remain absolutely motionless and give no sign of life. To see
them dipping vertically, head downwards, into the florets, one might
suppose that they were seeking some sweet liquid, their food; but in
that case they ought to pass more frequently from one floret to
another, which they do not, except when, after a false alarm, they
regain their hiding-places and choose the spot which seems to them
the most favourable. This immobility means that the florets of the
camomile serve them only as a place of ambush, even as later the
Anthophora's body will serve them solely as a vehicle to convey them
to the Bee's cell. They take no nourishment, either on the flowers or
on the Bees; and, as with the Sitares, their first meal will consist
of the Anthophora's egg, which the hooks of their mandibles are
intended to rip open.</p>

<p>Their immobility is, as we have said, complete; but nothing is easier
than to arouse their suspended activity. Shake a camomile-blossom
lightly with a bit of straw: instantly the Meloes leave their
hiding-places, come <a name="page98"></a>up and scatter in all directions on the white
petals of the circumference, running over them from one end to the
other with all the speed which the smallness of their size permits.
On reaching the extreme end of the petals, they fasten to it either
with their caudal appendages, or perhaps with a sticky substance
similar to that furnished by the anal button of the Sitares; and,
with their bodies hanging outside and their six legs free, they bend
about in every direction and stretch as far out as they can, as
though striving to touch an object out of their reach. If nothing
offers for them to seize upon, after a few vain attempts they regain
the centre of the flower and soon resume their immobility.</p>

<p>But, if we place near them any object whatever, they do not fail to
catch on to it with surprising agility. A blade of grass, a bit of
straw, the handle of my tweezers which I hold out to them: they
accept anything in their eagerness to quit the provisional shelter of
the flower. It is true that, after finding themselves on these
inanimate objects, they soon recognize that they have gone astray, as
we see by their bustling movements to and fro and their tendency to
go back to the flower if there still be time. <a name="page99"></a>Those which have thus
giddily flung themselves upon a bit of straw and are allowed to
return to their flower do not readily fall a second time into the
same trap. There is therefore, in these animated specks, a memory, an
experience of things.</p>

<p>After these experiments I tried others with hairy materials imitating
more or less closely the down of the Bees, with little pieces of
cloth or velvet cut from my clothes, with plugs of cotton wool, with
pellets of flock gathered from the everlastings. Upon all these
objects, offered with the tweezers, the Meloes flung themselves
without any difficulty; but, instead of keeping quiet, as they do on
the bodies of the Bees, they soon convinced me, by their restless
behaviour, that they found themselves as much out of their element on
these furry materials as on the smooth surface of a bit of straw. I
ought to have expected this: had I not just seen them wandering
without pause upon the everlastings enveloped with cottony flock? If
reaching the shelter of a downy surface were enough to make them
believe themselves safe in harbour, nearly all would perish, without
further attempts, in the down of the plants.</p>

<p>Let us now offer them live insects and, first of all, Anthophoræ. If
the Bee, after we <a name="page100"></a>have rid her of the parasites which she may be
carrying, be taken by the wings and held for a moment in contact with
the flower, we invariably find her, after this rapid contact, overrun
by Meloes clinging to her hairs. The larvæ nimbly take up their
position on the thorax, usually on the shoulders or sides, and once
there they remain motionless: the second stage of their strange
journey is compassed.</p>

<p>After the Anthophoræ, I tried the first live insects that I was able
to procure at once: Drone-flies, Bluebottles, Hive-bees, small
Butterflies. All were alike overrun by the Meloes, without
hesitation. What is more, there was no attempt made to return to the
flowers. As I could not find any Beetles at the moment, I was unable
to experiment with them. Newport, experimenting, it is true, under
conditions very different from mine, since his observations related
to young Meloes held captive in a glass jar, while mine were made in
the normal circumstances, Newport, I was saying, saw Meloes fasten to
the body of a Malachius and stay there without moving, which inclines
me to believe that with Beetles I should have obtained the same
results as, for instance, with a Drone-fly. And I did, in fact, at a
later date, find <a name="page101"></a>some Meloe-larvæ on the body of a big Beetle, the
Golden Rose-chafer (<i>Cetonia aurata</i>), an assiduous visitor of the
flowers.</p>

<p>After exhausting the insect class, I put within their reach my last
resource, a large black Spider. Without hesitation they passed from
the flower to the arachnid, made for places near the joints of the
legs and settled there without moving. Everything therefore seems to
suit their plans for leaving the provisional abode where they are
waiting; without distinction of species, genus, or class, they fasten
to the first living creature that chance brings within their reach.
We now understand how it is that these young larvæ have been observed
upon a host of different insects and especially upon the early Flies
and Bees pillaging the flowers; we can also understand the need for
that prodigious number of eggs laid by a single Oil-beetle, since the
vast majority of the larvæ which come out of them will infallibly go
astray and will not succeed in reaching the cells of the Anthophoræ.
Instinct is at fault here; and fecundity makes up for it.</p>

<p>But instinct recovers its infallibility in another case. The Meloes,
as we have seen, pass without difficulty from the flower to the
objects within their reach, whatever these <a name="page102"></a>may be, smooth or hairy,
living or inanimate. This done, they behave very differently,
according as they have chanced to invade the body of an insect or
some other object. In the first case, on a downy Fly or Butterfly, on
a smooth-skinned Spider or Beetle, the larvæ remain motionless after
reaching the point which suits them. Their instinctive desire is
therefore satisfied. In the second case, in the midst of the nap of
cloth or velvet, or the filaments of cotton, or the flock of the
everlasting, or, lastly, on the smooth surface of a leaf or a straw,
they betray the knowledge of their mistake by their continual coming
and going, by their efforts to return to the flower imprudently
abandoned.</p>

<p>How then do they recognize the nature of the object to which they
have just moved? How is it that this object, whatever the quality of
its surface, will sometimes suit them and sometimes not? Do they
judge their new lodging by sight? But then no mistake would be
possible; the sense of sight would tell them at the outset whether
the object within reach was suitable or not; and emigration would or
would not take place according to its decision. And then how can we
suppose that, buried in the dense thicket of a pellet of cotton-wool
or in the fleece of an <a name="page103"></a>Anthophora, the imperceptible larva can
recognize, by sight, the enormous mass which it is perambulating?</p>

<p>Is it by touch, by some sensation due to the inner vibrations of
living flesh? Not so, for the Meloes remain motionless on insect
corpses that have dried up completely, on dead Anthophoræ taken from
cells at least a year old. I have seen them keep absolutely quiet on
fragments of an Anthophora on a thorax long since nibbled and emptied
by the Mites. By what sense then can they distinguish the thorax of
an Anthophora from a velvety pellet, when sight and touch are out of
the question? The sense of smell remains. But in that case what
exquisite subtlety must we not take for granted? Moreover, what
similarity of smell can we admit between all the insects which, dead
or alive, whole or in pieces, fresh or dried, suit the Meloes, while
anything else does not suit them? A wretched louse, a living speck,
leaves us mightily perplexed as to the sensibility which directs it.
Here is yet one more riddle added to all the others.</p>

<p>After the observations which I have described, it remained for me to
search the earthen surface inhabited by the Anthophoræ: I should then
have followed the <a name="page104"></a>Meloe-larva in its transformations. It was
certainly <i>cicatricosus</i> whose larvæ I had been studying; it was
certainly this insect which ravaged the cells of the Mason-bee, for I
found it dead in the old galleries which it had been unable to leave.
This opportunity, which did not occur again, promised me an ample
harvest. I had to give it all up. My Thursday was drawing to a close;
I had to return to Avignon, to resume my lessons on the electrophorus
and the Toricellian tube. O happy Thursdays! What glorious
opportunities I lost because you were too short!</p>

<p>We will go back a year to continue this history. I collected, under
far less favourable conditions, it is true, enough notes to map out
the biography of the tiny creature which we have just seen migrating
from the camomile-flowers to the Anthophora's back. From what I have
said of the Sitaris-larvæ, it is plain that the Meloe-larvæ perched,
like the former, on the back of a Bee, have but one aim: to get
themselves conveyed by this Bee to the victualled cells. Their object
is not to live for a time on the body that carries them.</p>

<p>Were it necessary to prove this, it would be enough to say that we
never see these <a name="page105"></a>larvæ attempt to pierce the skin of the Bee, or else
to nibble at a hair or two, nor do we see them increase in size so
long as they are on the Bee's body. To the Meloes, as to the Sitares,
the Anthophora serves merely as a vehicle which conveys them to their
goal, the victualled cell.</p>

<p>It remains for us to learn how the Meloe leaves the down of the Bee
which has carried it, in order to enter the cell. With larvæ
collected from the bodies of different Bees, before I was fully
acquainted with the tactics of the Sitares, I undertook, as Newport
had done before me, certain investigations intended to throw light on
this leading point in the Oil-beetle's history. My attempts, based
upon those which I had made with the Sitares, resulted in the same
failure. The tiny creatures, when brought into contact with
Anthophora-larvæ or -nymphs, paid no attention whatever to their
prey; others, placed near cells which were open and full of honey,
did not enter them, or at most ventured to the edge of the orifice;
others, lastly, put inside the cell, on the dry wall or on the
surface of the honey, came out again immediately or else got stuck
and died. The touch of the honey is as fatal to them as to the young
Sitares.</p>
<a name="page106"></a>
<p>Searches made at various periods in the nests of the Hairy-footed
Anthophora had taught me some years earlier that <i>Meloe
cicatricosus</i>, like the Sitares, is a parasite of that Bee; indeed I
had at different times discovered adult Meloes, dead and shrivelled,
in the Bee's cells. On the other hand, I knew from Léon Dufour that
the little yellow animal, the Louse found in the Bee's down, had been
recognized, thanks to Newport's investigations, as the larva of the
Oil-beetle. With these data, rendered still more striking by what I
was learning daily on the subject of the Sitares, I went to
Carpentras, on the 21st of May, to inspect the nests of the
Anthophoræ, then building, as I have described. Though I was almost
certain of succeeding, sooner or later, with the Sitares, who were
excessively abundant, I had very little hope of the Meloes, which on
the contrary are very scarce in the same nests. Circumstances,
however, favoured me more than I dared hope and, after six hours'
labour, in which the pick played a great part, I became the
possessor, by the sweat of my brow, of a considerable number of cells
occupied by Sitares and two other cells appropriated by Meloes.</p>
<a name="page107"></a>
<p>While my enthusiasm had not had time to cool at the sight,
momentarily repeated, of a young Sitaris perched upon an Anthophora's
egg floating in the centre of the little pool of honey, it might well
have burst all restraints on beholding the contents of one of these
cells. On the black, liquid honey a wrinkled pellicle is floating;
and on this pellicle, motionless, is a yellow louse. The pellicle is
the empty envelope of the Anthophora's egg; the louse is a
Meloe-larva.</p>

<p>The story of this larva becomes self-evident. The young Meloe leaves
the down of the Bee at the moment when the egg is laid; and, since
contact with the honey would be fatal to the grub, it must, in order
to save itself, adopt the tactics followed by the Sitaris, that is to
say, it must allow itself to drop on the surface of the honey with
the egg which is in the act of being laid. There, its first task is
to devour the egg which serves it for a raft, as is attested by the
empty envelope on which it still remains; and it is after this meal,
the only one that it takes so long as it retains its present form,
that it must commence its long series of transformations and feed
upon the honey amassed by the Anthophora. This was the reason of the
complete failure both of my attempts <a name="page108"></a>and of Newport's to rear the
young Meloe-larvæ. Instead of offering them honey, or larvæ, or
nymphs, we should have placed them on the eggs recently laid by the
Anthophora.</p>

<p>On my return from Carpentras, I meant to try this method, together
with that of the Sitares, with which I had been so successful; but,
as I had no Meloe-larvæ at my disposal and could not obtain any save
by searching for them in the Bees' fleece, the Anthophora-eggs were
all discovered to have hatched in the cells which I brought back from
my expedition, when I was at last able to find some. This lost
experiment is little to be regretted, for, since the Meloes and the
Sitares exhibiting the completest similarity not only in habits but
also in their method of evolution, there is no doubt whatever that I
should have succeeded. I even believe that this method may be
attempted with the cells of various Bees, provided that the eggs and
the honey do not differ too greatly from the Anthophora's. I should
not, for example, count on being successful with the cells of the
three-horned Osmia, who shares the Anthophora's quarters: her egg is
short and thick; and her honey is yellow, odourless, solid, almost a
powder and very faintly flavoured.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<center>HYPERMETAMORPHOSIS</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>By a Machiavellian stratagem the primary larva of the Oil-beetle or
the Sitaris has penetrated the Anthophora's cell; it has settled on
the egg, which is its first food and its life-raft in one. What
becomes of it once the egg is exhausted?</p>

<p>Let us, to begin with, go back to the larva of the Sitaris. By the
end of a week the Anthophora's egg has been drained dry by the
parasite and is reduced to the envelope, a shallow skiff which
preserves the tiny creature from the deadly contact of the honey. It
is on this skiff that the first transformation takes place,
whereafter the larva, which is now organized to live in a glutinous
environment, drops off the raft into the pool of honey and leaves its
empty skin, split along the back, clinging to the pellicle of the
egg. At this stage we see floating motionless on the honey a
milk-white atom, oval, flat and a twelfth of an inch long. This is
the larva of the Sitaris in its new form. With the aid of a lens we
can distinguish the <a name="page110"></a>fluctuations of the digestive canal, which is
gorging itself with honey; and along the circumference of the flat,
elliptical back we perceive a double row of breathing-pores which,
thanks to their position, cannot be choked by the viscous liquid.
Before describing the larva in detail we will wait for it to attain
its full development, which cannot take long, for the provisions are
rapidly diminishing.</p>

<p>The rapidity however is not to be compared with that with which the
gluttonous larvæ of the Anthophora consume their food. Thus, on
visiting the dwellings of the Anthophoræ for the last time, on the
25th of June, I found that the Bee's larvæ had all finished their
rations and attained their full development, whereas those of the
Sitares, still immersed in the honey, were, for the most part, only
half the size which they must finally attain. This is yet another
reason why the Sitares should destroy an egg which, were it to
develop, would produce a voracious larva, capable of starving them in
a very short time. When rearing the larvæ myself in test-tubes, I
have found that the Sitares take thirty-five to forty days to finish
their mess of honey and that the larvæ of the Anthophora spend less
than a fortnight over the same meal.</p>
<a name="page111"></a>
<p>It is in the first half of July that the Sitaris-grubs reach their
full dimensions. At this period the cell usurped by the parasite
contains nothing beyond a full-fed larva and, in a corner, a heap of
reddish droppings. This larva is soft and white, about half an inch
in length and a quarter of an inch wide at its broadest part. Seen
from above as it floats on the honey, it is elliptical in form,
tapering gradually towards the front and more suddenly towards the
rear. Its ventral surface is highly convex; its dorsal surface, on
the contrary, is almost flat. When the larva is floating on the
liquid honey, it is as it were steadied by the excessive development
of the ventral surface immersed in the honey, which enables it to
acquire an equilibrium that is of the greatest importance to its
welfare. In fact, the breathing-holes, arranged without means of
protection on either edge of the almost flat back, are level with the
viscous liquid and would be choked by that sticky glue at the least
false movement, if a suitably ballasted hold did not prevent the
larva from heeling over. Never was corpulent abdomen of greater use:
thanks to this plumpness of the belly the larva is protected from
asphyxia.</p>

<p>Its segments number thirteen, including <a name="page112"></a>the head. This head is pale,
soft, like the rest of the body, and very small compared with the
rest of the creature. The antennæ are excessively short and consist
of two cylindrical joints. I have vainly looked for the eyes with a
powerful magnifying-glass. In its former state, the larva, subject to
strange migrations, obviously needs the sense of sight and is
provided with four ocelli. In its present state, of what use would
eyes be to it at the bottom of a clay cell, where the most absolute
darkness prevails?</p>

<p>The labrum is prominent, is not distinctly divided from the head, is
curved in front and edged with pale and very fine bristles. The
mandibles are small, reddish toward the tips, blunt and hollowed out
spoonwise on the inner side. Below the mandibles is a fleshy part
crowned with two very tiny nipples. This is the lower lip with its
two palpi. It is flanked right and left by two other parts, likewise
fleshy, adhering closely to the lip and bearing at the tip a
rudimentary palp consisting of two or three very tiny joints. These
two parts are the future jaws. All this apparatus of lips and jaws is
completely immobile and in a rudimentary condition which is difficult
to describe. They are budding organs, still faint and embryonic. The
<a name="page113"></a>labrum and the complicated lamina formed by the lip and the jaws
leave between them a narrow slit in which the mandibles work.</p>

<p>The legs are merely vestiges, for, though they consist of three tiny
cylindrical joints, they are barely a fiftieth of an inch in length.
The creature is unable to make use of them, not only in the liquid
honey upon which it lives, but even on a solid surface. If we take
the larva from the cell and place it on a hard substance, to observe
it more readily, we see that the inordinate protuberance of the
abdomen, by lifting the thorax from the ground, prevents the legs
from finding a support. Lying on its side, the only possible position
because of its conformation, the larva remains motionless or only
makes a few lazy, wriggling movements of the abdomen, without ever
stirring its feeble limbs, which for that matter could not assist it
in any way. In short, the tiny creature of the first stage, so active
and alert, is succeeded by a ventripotent grub, deprived of movement
by its very obesity. Who would recognize in this clumsy, flabby,
blind, hideously pot-bellied creature, with nothing but a sort of
stumps for legs, the elegant pigmy of but a little while back,
armour-clad, slender and <a name="page114"></a>provided with highly perfected organs for
performing its perilous journeys?</p>

<p>Lastly, we count nine pairs of stigmata: one pair on the mesothorax
and the rest on the first eight segments of the abdomen. The last
pair, that on the eighth abdominal segment, consists of stigmata so
small that to detect them we have to gather their position by that in
the succeeding states of the larva and to pass a very patient
magnifying-glass along the direction of the other pairs. These are as
yet but vestigial stigmata. The others are fairly large, with pale,
round, flat edges.</p>

<p>If in its first form the Sitaris-larva is organized for action, to
obtain possession of the coveted cell, in its second form it is
organized solely to digest the provisions acquired. Let us take a
glance at its internal structure and in particular at its digestive
apparatus. Here is a strange thing: this apparatus, in which the
hoard of honey amassed by the Anthophora is to be engulfed, is
similar in every respect to that of the adult Sitaris, who possibly
never takes food. We find in both the same very short oesophagus, the
same chylific ventricle, empty in the perfect insect, distended in
the larva with an abundant orange-coloured pulp; in both the <a name="page115"></a>same
gall-bladders, four in number, connected with the rectum by one of
their extremities. Like the perfect insect, the larva is devoid of
salivary glands or any other similar apparatus. Its nervous system
comprises eleven ganglia, not counting the oesophageal collar,
whereas in the perfect insect there are only seven: three for the
thorax, of which the last two are contiguous, and four for the
abdomen.</p>

<p>When its rations are finished the larva remains a few days in a
motionless condition, ejecting from time to time a few reddish
droppings until the digestive canal is completely cleared of its
orange-coloured pulp. Then the creature contracts itself, huddles
itself together; and before long we see coming detached from its body
a transparent, slightly crumpled and extremely fine pellicle, forming
a closed bag, in which the successive transformations will take place
henceforth. On this epidermal bag, this sort of transparent leather
bottle, formed by the larva's skin detached all of a piece, without a
slit of any kind, we can distinguish the several well-preserved
external organs: the head, with its antennæ, mandibles, paws and
palpi; the thoracic segments, with their vestiges of legs; the
abdomen, with its chain of <a name="page116"></a>breathing-holes still connected one to
another by tracheal threads.</p>

<p>Then beneath this pellicle, which is so delicate that it can hardly
bear the most cautious touch, we see a soft, white mass taking shape,
a mass which in a few hours acquires a firm, horny consistency and a
vivid yellow hue. The transformation is now complete. Let us tear the
fine gauze bag enclosing the organism which has just come into being
and direct our investigation to this third form of the Sitaris-larva.</p>

<p>It is an inert, segmented body, with an oval outline, a horny
consistency, just like that of pupæ and chrysalids, and a
bright-yellow colour, which we can best describe by likening it to
that of a lemon-drop. Its upper surface forms a double inclined plane
with a very blunt ridge; its lower surface is at first flat, but, as
the result of evaporation, becomes more concave daily, leaving a
projecting rim all around its oval outline. Lastly, its two
extremities or poles are slightly flattened. The major axis of the
lower surface averages half an inch in length and the minor axis a
quarter of an inch.</p>

<p>At the cephalic pole of this body is a sort of mask, modelled roughly
on the head of the larva, and at the opposite pole a small <a name="page117"></a>circular
disk deeply wrinkled at the centre. The three segments that come
after the head bear each a pair of very minute knobs, hardly visible
without the lens: these are, to the legs of the larva in its previous
form, what the cephalic mask is to the head of the same larva. They
are not organs, but indications, landmarks placed at the points where
these organs will appear later. On either side we count nine
stigmata, set as before on the mesothorax and the first eight
abdominal segments. The first eight breathing-holes are dark brown
and stand out plainly against the yellow colour of the body. They
consist of small, shiny, conical knobs, perforated at the top with a
round hole. The ninth stigma, though fashioned like the others, is
ever so much smaller; it cannot be distinguished without the lens.</p>

<p>The anomaly, already so manifest in the change from the first form to
the second, becomes even more so here; and we do not know what name
to give to an organism without a standard of comparison, not only in
the order of Beetles, but in the whole class of insects. While, on
the one hand, this organism offers many points of resemblance to the
pupæ of the Flies in its horny consistency, in the complete
immobility of its <a name="page118"></a>various segments, in the all but absolute absence
of relief which would enable one to distinguish the parts of the
perfect insect; while, on the other hand, it approximates to the
chrysalids, because the creature, to attain this condition, has to
shed its skin, as the caterpillars do, it differs from the pupa
because it has for covering not the surface skin, which has become
horny, but rather one of the inner skins of the larva; and it differs
from the chrysalids by the absence of mouldings which in the latter
betray the appendages of the perfect insect. Lastly, it differs yet
more profoundly from the pupa and the chrysalis because from both
these organisms the perfect insect springs straightway, whereas that
which follows what we are considering is simply a larva like that
which went before. I shall suggest, to denote this curious organism,
the term <i>pseudochrysalis;</i> and I shall reserve the names <i>primary
larva</i>, <i>secondary larva</i> and <i>tertiary larva</i> to denote, in a couple
of words, each of the three forms under which the Sitares possess all
the characteristics of larvæ.</p>

<p>Although the Sitaris, on assuming the form of the pseudochrysalis, is
transfigured outwardly to the point of baffling the science of
entomological phases, this is not so <a name="page119"></a>inwardly. I have at every season
of the year examined the viscera of the pseudochrysalids, which
generally remain stationary for a whole year, and I have never
observed other forms among their organs than those which we find in
the secondary larva. The nervous system has undergone no change. The
digestive apparatus is absolutely void and, because of its emptiness,
appears only as a thin cord, sunk, lost amid the adipose sacs. The
stercoral intestine has more substance; its outlines are better
defined. The four gall-bladders are always perfectly distinct. The
adipose tissue is more abundant than ever: it forms by itself the
whole contents of the pseudochrysalis, for in the matter of volume
the insignificant threads of the nervous system and the digestive
apparatus count for nothing. It is the reserve upon which life must
draw for its future labours.</p>

<p>A few Sitares remain hardly a month in the pseudochrysalis stage. The
other phases are achieved in the course of August; and at the
beginning of September the insect attains the perfect state. But as a
rule the development is slower; the pseudochrysalis goes through the
winter; and it is not, at the earliest, until June in the second year
that <a name="page120"></a>the final transformations take place. Let us pass in silence
over this long period of repose, during which the Sitaris, in the
form of a pseudochrysalis, slumbers at the bottom of its cell, in a
sleep as lethargic as that of a germ in its egg, and come to the
months of June and July in the following year, the period of what we
might call a second hatching.</p>

<p>The pseudochrysalis is still enclosed in the delicate pouch formed of
the skin of the secondary larva. Outside, nothing fresh has happened;
but important changes have taken place inside. I have said that the
pseudochrysalis displayed an upper surface arched like a hog's back
and a lower surface at first flat and then more and more concave. The
sides of the double inclined plane of the upper or dorsal surface
also share in this depression occasioned by the evaporation of the
fluid constituents; and a time comes when these sides are so
depressed that a section of the pseudochrysalis through a plane
perpendicular to its axis would be represented by a curvilinear
triangle with blunted corners and inwardly convex sides. This is the
appearance displayed by the pseudochrysalis during the winter and
spring.</p>

<p>But in June it has lost this withered <a name="page121"></a>appearance; it represents a
perfect balloon, an ellipsoid of which the sections perpendicular to
the major axis are circles. Something has also come to pass of
greater importance than this expansion, which may be compared with
that which we obtain by blowing into a wrinkled bladder. The horny
integuments of the pseudochrysalis have become detached from their
contents, all of a piece, without a break, just as happened the year
before with the skin of the secondary larva; and they thus form a
fresh vesicular envelope, free from any adhesion to the contents and
itself enclosed in the pouch formed of the secondary larva's skin. Of
these two bags without outlet, one of which is enclosed within the
other, the outer is transparent, flexible, colourless and extremely
delicate; the second is brittle, almost as delicate as the first, but
much less translucent because of its yellow colouring, which makes it
resemble a thin flake of amber. On this second sac are found the
stigmatic warts, the thoracic studs and so forth, which we noted on
the pseudochrysalis. Lastly, within its cavity we catch a glimpse of
something the shape of which at once recalls to mind the secondary
larva.</p>

<p>And indeed, if we tear the double envelope <a name="page122"></a>which protects this
mystery, we recognize, not without astonishment, that we have before
our eyes a new larva similar to the secondary. After one of the
strangest transformations, the creature has gone back to its second
form. To describe the new larva is unnecessary, for it differs from
the former in only a few slight details. In both there is the same
head, with its various appendages barely outlined; the same vestiges
of legs, the same stumps transparent as crystal. The tertiary larva
differs from the secondary only by its abdomen, which is less fat,
owing to the absolute emptiness of the digestive apparatus; by a
double chain of fleshy cushions extending along each side; by the rim
of the stigmata, crystalline and slightly projecting, but less so
than in the pseudochrysalis; by the ninth pair of breathing-holes,
hitherto rudimentary but now almost as large as the rest; lastly by
the mandibles ending in a very sharp point. Evicted from its twofold
sheath, the tertiary larva makes only very lazy movements of
contraction and dilation, without being able to advance, without even
being able to maintain its normal position, because of the weakness
of its legs. It usually remains motionless, lying on its side, or
else displays its <a name="page123"></a>drowsy activity merely by feeble, wormlike
movements.</p>

<p>By dint of these alternate contractions and dilations, indolent
though they be, the larva nevertheless contrives to turn right round
in the sort of shell with which the pseudochrysalidal integuments
provide it, when by accident it finds itself placed head downwards;
and this operation is all the more difficult inasmuch as the larva
almost exactly fills the cavity of the shell. The creature contracts,
bends its head under its belly and slides its front half over its
hinder half by wormlike movements so slow that the lens can hardly
detect them. In less than a quarter of an hour the larva, at first
turned upside down, finds itself again head uppermost. I admire this
gymnastic feat, but have some difficulty in understanding it, so
small is the space which the larva, when at rest in its cell, leaves
unoccupied, compared with that which we should be justified in
expecting from the possibility of such a reversal. The larva does not
long enjoy the privilege which enables it to resume inside its cell,
when this is moved from its original position, the attitude which it
prefers, that is to say, with its head up.</p>

<p>Two days, at most, after its first <a name="page124"></a>appearance it relapses into an
inertia as complete as that of the pseudochrysalis. On removing it
from its amber shell, we see that its faculty of contracting or
dilating at will is so completely paralysed that the stimulus of a
needle is unable to provoke it, though the integuments have retained
all their flexibility and though no perceptible change has occurred
in the organization. The irritability, therefore, which in the
pseudochrysalis is suspended for a whole year, reawakens for a
moment, to relapse instantly into the deepest torpor. This torpor
will be partly dispelled only at the moment of the passing into the
nymphal stage, to return immediately afterwards and last until the
insect attains the perfect state.</p>

<p>Further, on holding larvæ of the third form, or nymphs enclosed in
their cells, in an inverted position, in glass tubes, we never see
them regain an erect position, however long we continue the
experiment. The perfect insect itself, during the time that it is
enclosed in the shell, cannot regain it, for lack of the requisite
flexibility. This total absence of movement in the tertiary larva,
when a few days old, and also in the nymph, together with the
smallness of the space left free in the shell, would necessarily lead
to <a name="page125"></a>the conviction, if we had not witnessed the first moments of the
tertiary larva, that it is absolutely impossible for the creature to
turn right round.</p>

<p>And now see to what curious inferences this lack of observations made
at the due moment may lead us. We collect some pseudochrysalids and
heap them in a glass jar in all possible positions. The favourable
season arrives; and with very legitimate astonishment we find that,
in a large number of shells, the larva or nymph occupies an inverted
position, that is to say, the head is turned towards the anal
extremity of the shell. In vain we watch these reversed bodies for
any indications of movement; in vain we place the shells in every
imaginable position, to see if the creature will turn round; in vain,
once more, we ask ourselves where the free space is which this
turning would demand. The illusion is complete: I have been taken in
by it myself; and for two years I indulged in the wildest conjectures
to account for this lack of correspondence between the shell and its
contents, to explain, in short, a fact which is inexplicable once the
propitious moment has passed.</p>

<p>On the natural site, in the cells of the <a name="page126"></a>Anthophora, this apparent
anomaly never occurs, because the secondary larva, when on the point
of transformation into the pseudochrysalis, is always careful to
place its head uppermost, according as the axis of the cell more or
less nearly approaches the vertical. But, when the pseudochrysalids
are placed higgledy-piggledy in a box or jar, all those which are
upside down will later contain inverted larvæ or nymphs.</p>

<p>After four changes of form so profound as those which I have
described, one might reasonably expect to find some modifications of
the internal organization. Nevertheless, nothing is changed; the
nervous system is the same in the tertiary larva as in the earlier
phases; the reproductive organs do not yet show; and there is no need
to mention the digestive apparatus, which remains invariable even in
the perfect insect.</p>

<p>The duration of the tertiary larva is a bare four or five weeks,
which is also about the duration of the second. In July, when the
secondary larva passes into the pseudochrysalid stage, the tertiary
larva passes into the nymphal stage, still inside the double
vesicular envelope. Its skin splits along the back in front; and with
the assistance of a few feeble contractions, which reappear at <a name="page127"></a>this
juncture, it is thrust behind in the shape of a little ball. There is
therefore nothing here that differs from what happens in the other
Beetles.</p>

<p>Nor does the nymph which succeeds this tertiary larva present any
peculiarity: it is the perfect insect in swaddling-bands, yellowish
white, with its various external members, clear as crystal, displayed
under the abdomen. A few weeks elapse, during which the nymph partly
dons the livery of the adult state; and, in about a month, the insect
moults for a last time, in the usual manner, in order to attain its
final form. The wing-cases are now of a uniform yellowish white, as
are the wings, the abdomen and the greater part of the legs; very
nearly all the rest of the body is of a glossy black. In the space of
twenty-four hours, the wing-cases assume their half-black,
half-russet colouring; the wings grow darker; and the legs finish
turning black. This done, the adult organism is completed. However,
the Sitaris remains still a fortnight in the intact shell, ejecting
at intervals white droppings of uric acid, which it pushes back
together with the shreds of its last two sloughs, those of the
tertiary larva and of the nymph. Lastly, about the middle of August,
it tears the double bag <a name="page128"></a>that contains it, pierces the lid of the
Anthophora's cell, enters a corridor and appears outside in quest of
the other sex.</p>

<p>I have told how, while digging in search of the Sitaris, I found two
cells belonging to <i>Meloe cicatricosus</i>. One contained an
Anthophora's egg; with this egg was a yellow Louse, the primary larva
of the Meloe. The history of this tiny creature we know. The second
cell also was full of honey. On the sticky liquid floated a little
white larva, about a sixth of an inch in length and very different
from the other little white larvæ belonging to Sitares. The rapid
fluctuations of the abdomen showed that it was eagerly drinking the
strong-scented nectar collected by the Bee. This larva was the young
Meloe in the second period of its development.</p>

<p>I was not able to preserve these two precious cells, which I had
opened wide to examine the contents. On my return from Carpentras, I
found that their honey had been spilt by the motion of the carriage
and that their inhabitants were dead. On the 25th of June, a fresh
visit to the nests of the Anthophoræ furnished me with two larvæ like
the foregoing, but much larger. One of them was on the point of
finishing its store of honey, the other still had nearly half left.
<a name="page129"></a>The first was put in a place of safety with a thousand precautions,
the second was at once immersed in alcohol.</p>

<p>These larvæ are blind, soft, fleshy, yellowish white, covered with a
fine down visible only under the lens, curved into a fish-hook like
the larvæ of the Lamellicorns, to which they bear a certain
resemblance in their general configuration. The segments, including
the head, number thirteen, of which nine are provided with
breathing-holes with a pale, oval rim. These are the mesothorax and
the first eight abdominal segments. As in the Sitaris-larvæ, the last
pair of stigmata, that of the eighth segment of the abdomen, is less
developed than the rest.</p>

<p>The head is horny, of a light brown colour. The epistoma is edged
with brown. The labrum is prominent, white and trapezoidal. The
mandibles are black, strong, short, obtuse, only slightly curved,
sharp-edged and furnished each with a broad tooth on the inner side.
The maxillary and labial palpi are brown and shaped like very small
studs with two or three joints to them. The antennæ, inserted just at
the base of the mandibles, are brown, and consist of three sections:
the first is thick and globular; the two others are much smaller in
diameter and <a name="page130"></a>cylindrical. The legs are short, but fairly strong, able
to serve the creature for crawling or digging; they end in a strong
black claw. The length of the larva when fully developed is one inch.</p>

<p>As far as I can judge from the dissection of the specimen preserved
in alcohol, whose viscera were affected by being kept too long in
that liquid, the nervous system consists of eleven ganglia, not
counting the oesophageal collar; and the digestive apparatus does not
differ perceptibly from that of an adult Oil-beetle.</p>

<p>The larger of the two larvæ of the 25th of June, placed in a
test-tube with what remained of its provisions, assumed a new form
during the first week of the following month. Its skin split along
the front dorsal half and, after being pushed half back, left partly
uncovered a pseudochrysalis bearing the closest analogy with that of
the Sitares. Newport did not see the larva of the Oil-beetle in its
second form, that which it displays when it is eating the mess of
honey hoarded by the Bees, but he did see its moulted skin
half-covering the pseudochrysalis which I have just mentioned. From
the sturdy mandibles and the legs armed with a powerful claw which he
observed on this moulted skin, <a name="page131"></a>Newport assumed that, instead of
remaining in the same Anthophora-cell, the larva, which is capable of
burrowing, passes from one cell to another in search of additional
nourishment. This suspicion seems to me to be well-founded, for the
size which the larva finally attains exceeds the proportions which
the small quantity of honey enclosed in a single cell would lead us
to expect.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the pseudochrysalis. It is, as in the Sitares, an
inert body, of a horny consistency, amber-coloured and divided into
thirteen segments, including the head. Its length is 20
millimetres.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> It is slightly curved into an arc, highly convex on
the dorsal surface, almost flat on the ventral surface and edged with
a projecting fillet which marks the division between the two. The
head is only a sort of mask on which certain features are vaguely
carved in still relief, corresponding with the future parts of the
head. On the thoracic segments are three pairs of tubercles,
corresponding with the legs of the recent larva and the future
insect. Lastly, there are nine pairs of stigmata, one pair on the
mesothorax and the eight following pairs on the first eight segments
of the abdomen. The last pair is <a name="page132"></a>rather smaller than the rest, a
peculiarity which we have already noted in the larva which precedes
the pseudochrysalis.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> .787 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>On comparing the pseudochrysalids of the Oil-beetles and Sitares, we
observe a most striking similarity between the two. The same
structure occurs in both, down to the smallest details. We find on
either side the same cephalic masks, the same tubercles occupying the
place of the legs, the same distribution and the same number of
stigmata and, lastly, the same colour, the same rigidity of the
integuments. The only points of difference are in the general
appearance, which is not the same in the two pseudochrysalids, and in
the covering formed by the cast skin of the late larva. In the
Sitares, in fact, this cast skin constitutes a closed bag, a pouch
completely enveloping the pseudochrysalis; in the Oil-beetles, on the
contrary, it is split down the back and pushed to the rear and,
consequently, only half-covers the pseudochrysalis.</p>

<p>The post-mortem examination of the only pseudochrysalis in my
possession showed me that, similarly to that which happens in the
Sitares, no change occurred in the organization of the viscera,
notwithstanding the profound transformations which take place
<a name="page133"></a>externally. In the midst of innumerable little sacs of adipose tissue
is buried a thin thread in which we easily recognize the essential
features of the digestive apparatus, both of the preceding larval
form and of the perfect insect. As for the medullary cord of the
abdomen, it consists, as in the larva, of eight ganglia. In the
perfect insect it comprises only four.</p>

<p>I could not say positively how long the Oil-beetle remains in the
pseudochrysalid form; but, if we consider the very complete analogy
between the evolution of the Oil-beetles and that of the Sitares,
there is reason to believe that a few pseudochrysalids complete their
transformation in the same year, while others, in greater numbers,
remain stationary for a whole year and do not attain the state of the
perfect insect until the following spring. This is also the opinion
expressed by Newport.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, I found at the end of August one of these
pseudochrysalids which had already attained the nymphal stage. It is
with the help of this precious capture that I shall be able to finish
the story of the Oil-beetle's development. The horny integuments of
the pseudochrysalis are split along a fissure which includes the
whole ventral <a name="page134"></a>surface and the whole of the head and runs up the back
of the thorax. This cast skin, which is stiff and keeps its shape, is
half-enclosed, as was the pseudochrysalis, in the skin shed by the
secondary larva. Lastly, through the fissure, which divides it almost
in two, a Meloe-nymph half-emerges; so that, to all appearances, the
pseudochrysalis has been followed immediately by the nymph, which
does not happen with the Sitares, which pass from the first of these
two states to the second only by assuming an intermediary form
closely resembling that of the larva which eats the store of honey.</p>

<p>But these appearances are deceptive, for, on removing the nymph from
the split sheath formed by the integuments of the pseudochrysalis, we
find, at the bottom of this sheath, a third cast skin, the last of
those which the creature has so far rejected. This skin is even now
adhering to the nymph by a few tracheal filaments. If we soften it in
water, we easily recognize that it possesses an organization almost
identical with that which preceded the pseudochrysalis. In the latter
case only, the mandibles and the legs are not so robust. Thus, after
passing through the pseudochrysalid stage, the <a name="page135"></a>Oil-beetles for some
time resume the preceding form, almost without modification.</p>

<p>The nymph comes next. It presents no peculiarities. The only nymph
that I have reared attained the perfect insect state at the end of
September. Under ordinary conditions would the adult Oil-beetle have
emerged from her cell at this period? I do not think so, since the
pairing and egg-laying do not take place until the beginning of
spring. She would no doubt have spent the autumn and the winter in
the Anthophora's dwelling, only leaving it in the spring following.
It is even probable that, as a rule, the development is even slower
and that the Oil-beetles, like the Sitares, for the most part spend
the cold season in the pseudochrysalid state, a state well-adapted to
the winter torpor, and do not achieve their numerous forms until the
return of the warm weather.</p>

<p>The Sitares and Meloes belong to the same family, that of the
Meloidæ.<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> Their strange transformations must probably extend
throughout the group; indeed, I had the good fortune to discover a
third example, which I have not hitherto been able to study <a name="page136"></a>in all
its details after twenty-five years of investigation. On six
occasions, no oftener, during this long period I have set eyes on the
pseudochrysalis which I am about to describe. Thrice I obtained it
from old Chalicodoma-nests built upon a stone, nests which I at first
attributed to the Chalicodoma of the Walls and which I now refer with
greater probability to the Chalicodoma of the Sheds. I once extracted
it from the galleries bored by some wood-eating larva in the trunk of
a dead wild pear-tree, galleries afterwards utilized for the cells of
an Osmia, I do not know which. Lastly, I found a pair of them in
between the row of cocoons of the Three-pronged Osmia (<i>O.
tridentata</i>, DUF.), who provides a home for her larvæ in a channel
dug in the dry bramble stems. The insect in question therefore is a
parasite of the Osmiæ. When I extract it from the old
Chalicodoma-nests, I have to attribute it not to this Bee but to one
of the Osmiæ (<i>O. tricornis</i> and <i>O. Latreillii</i>) who, when making
their nests, utilize the old galleries of the Mason-bee.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> Later classifiers place both in the family of the
Cantharidæ.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The most nearly complete instances that I have seen furnishes me with
the following data: the pseudochrysalis is very closely enveloped in
the skin of the secondary larva, a <a name="page137"></a>skin consisting of fine
transparent pellicle, without any rent whatever. This is the pouch of
the Sitaris, save that it lies in immediate contact with the body
enclosed. On this jacket we distinguish three pairs of tiny legs,
reduced to short vestiges, to stumps. The head is in place, showing
quite perceptibly the fine mandibles and the other parts of the
mouth. There is no trace of eyes. Each side has a white edging of
shrivelled tracheæ, running from one stigmatic orifice to another.</p>

<p>Next comes the pseudochrysalis, horny, currant-red, cylindrical,
cone-shaped at both ends, slightly convex on the dorsal surface and
concave on the ventral surface. It is covered with delicate,
prominent spots, sprinkled very close together; it takes a lens to
show them. It is 1 centimetre long and 4 millimetres wide.<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> We can
distinguish a large knob of a head, on which the mouth is vaguely
outlined; three pairs of little shiny brown specks, which are the
hardly perceptible vestiges of the legs; and on each side a row of
eight black specks, which are the stigmatic orifices. The first speck
stands by itself, in front; the seven others, divided from the first
by an empty space, form a <a name="page138"></a>continuous row. Lastly, at the opposite end
is a little pit, the sign of the anal pore.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> .393 x .156 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Of the six pseudochrysalids which a lucky accident placed at my
disposal, four were dead; the other two were furnished by <i>Zonitis
mutica</i>. This justified my forecast, which from the first, with
analogy for my guide, made me attribute these curious organizations
to the genus Zonitis. The meloidal parasite of the Osmiæ, therefore,
is recognized. We have still to make the acquaintance of the primary
larva, which gets itself carried by the Osmia into the cell full of
honey, and the tertiary larva, the one which, at a given moment, must
be found contained in the pseudochrysalis, a larva which will be
succeeded by the nymph.</p>

<p>Let us recapitulate the strange metamorphoses which I have sketched.
Every Beetle-larva, before attaining the nymphal stage, undergoes a
greater or smaller number of moults, of changes of skin; but these
moults, which are intended to favour the development of the larva by
ridding it of covering that has become too tight for it, in no way
alter its external shape. After any moult that it may have undergone,
the larva retains the same characteristics. If it begin by being
tough, it will not become tender; if <a name="page139"></a>it be equipped with legs, it
will not be deprived of them later; if it be provided with ocelli, it
will not become blind. It is true that the diet of these non-variable
larvæ remains the same throughout their duration, as do the
conditions under which they are destined to live.</p>

<p>But suppose that this diet varies, that the environment in which they
are called upon to live changes, that the circumstances accompanying
their development are liable to great changes: it then becomes
evident that the moult may and even must adapt the organization of
the larva to these new conditions of existence. The primary larva of
the Sitaris lives on the body of the Anthophora. Its perilous
peregrinations demand agility of movement, long-sighted eyes and
masterly balancing-appliances; it has, in fact, a slender shape,
ocelli, legs and special organs adapted to averting a fall. Once
inside the Bee's cell, it has to destroy the egg; its sharp
mandibles, curved into hooks, will fulfil this office. This done,
there is a change of diet: after the Anthophora's egg the larva
proceeds to consume the ration of honey. The environment in which it
has to live also changes: instead of balancing itself on a hair of
the Anthophora, it has now to float <a name="page140"></a>on a sticky fluid; instead of
living in broad daylight, it has to remain plunged in the profoundest
darkness. Its sharp mandibles must therefore become hollowed into a
spoon that they may scoop up the honey; its legs, its cirri, its
balancing-appliances must disappear as useless and even harmful,
since all these organs can only involve the larva in serious danger,
by causing it to stick in the honey; its slender shape, its horny
integuments, its ocelli, being no longer necessary in a dark cell
where movement is impossible, where there are no rough encounters to
be feared, may likewise give place to complete blindness, to soft
integuments, to a heavy, slothful form. This transfiguration, which
everything shows to be indispensable to the life of the larva, is
effected by a simple moult.</p>

<p>We do not so plainly perceive the necessity of the subsequent forms,
which are so abnormal that nothing like them is known in all the rest
of the insect class. The larva which is fed on honey first adopts a
false chrysalid appearance and afterwards goes back to its earlier
form, though the necessity for these transformations escapes us
entirely. Here I am obliged to record the facts and to leave the task
of interpreting them to the <a name="page141"></a>future. The larva of the Meloidæ,
therefore, undergo four moults before attaining the nymphal state;
and after each moult their characteristics alter most profoundly.
During all these external changes, the internal organization remains
unchangingly the same; and it is only at the moment of the nymph's
appearance that the nervous system becomes concentrated and that the
reproductive organs are developed, absolutely as in the other
Beetles.</p>

<p>Thus, to the ordinary metamorphoses which make a Beetle pass
successively through the stages of larva, nymph and perfect insect,
the Meloidæ add others which repeatedly transform the larva's
exterior, without introducing any modification of its viscera. This
mode of development, which preludes the customary entomological forms
by the multiple transfigurations of the larva, certainly deserves a
special name: I suggest that of <i>hypermetamorphosis</i>.</p>

<p>Let us now recapitulate the more prominent facts of this essay.</p>

<p>The Sitares, the Meloes, the Zonites and apparently other Meloidæ,
possibly all of them, are in their earliest infancy parasites of the
harvesting Bees.</p>

<p>The larva of the Meloidæ, before <a name="page142"></a>reaching the nymphal state, passes
through four forms, which I call the <i>primary larva</i>, the <i>secondary
larva</i>, the <i>pseudochrysalis</i> and the <i>tertiary larva</i>. The passage
from one of these forms to the next is effected by a simple moult,
without any changes in the viscera.</p>

<p>The primary larva is leathery and settles on the Bee's body. Its
object is to get itself carried into a cell filled with honey. On
reaching the cell, it devours the Bee's egg; and its part is played.</p>

<p>The secondary larva is soft and differs completely from the primary
larva in its external characteristics. It feeds upon the honey
contained in the usurped cell.</p>

<p>The pseudochrysalis is a body deprived of all movement and clad in
horny integuments which may be compared with those of the pupæ and
chrysalids. On these integuments we see a cephalic mask without
distinct or movable parts, six tubercles indicating the legs and nine
pairs of breathing-holes. In the Sitares the pseudochrysalis is
enclosed in a sort of sealed pouch and in the Zonites in a
tight-fitting bag formed of the skin of the secondary larva. In the
Meloes it is simply half-sheathed in the split skin of the secondary
larva.</p>

<p>The tertiary larva reproduces almost <a name="page143"></a>exactly the peculiarities of the
second; it is enclosed, in the Sitares and probably also the Zonites,
in a double vesicular envelope formed of the skin of the secondary
larva and the slough of the pseudochrysalis. In the Meloes, it is
half-enclosed in the split integuments of the pseudochrysalis, even
as these, in their turn, are half-enclosed in the skin of the
secondary larva.</p>

<p>From the tertiary larva onwards the metamorphoses follow their
habitual course, that is to say, this larva becomes a nymph; and this
nymph the perfect insect.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<center>CEROCOMÆ, MYLABRES AND ZONITES</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>All has not been told concerning the Meloidæ, those strange
parasites, some of which, the Sitares and the Oil-beetles, attach
themselves, like the tiniest of Lice, to the fleece of various Bees
to get themselves carried into the cell where they will destroy the
egg and afterwards feed upon the ration of honey. A most unexpected
discovery, made a few hundred yards from my door, has warned me once
again how dangerous it is to generalize. To take it for granted, as
the mass of data hitherto collected seemed to justify us in doing,
that all the Meloidæ of our country usurp the stores of honey
accumulated by the Bees, was surely a most judicious and natural
generalization. Many have accepted it without hesitation; and I for
my part was one of them. For on what are we to base our conviction
when we imagine that we are stating a law? We think to take our stand
upon the general; and we plunge into the <a name="page145"></a>quicksands of error. And
behold, the law of the Meloidæ has to be struck off the statutes, a
fate common to many others, as this chapter will prove.</p>

<p>On the 16th of July, 1883, I was digging, with my son Émile, in the
sandy heap where, a few days earlier, I had been observing the
labours and the surgery of the Mantis-killing Tachytes. My purpose
was to collect a few cocoons of this Digger-wasp. The cocoons were
turning up in abundance under my pocket-trowel, when Émile presented
me with an unknown object. Absorbed in my task of collection, I
slipped the find into my box without examining it further than with a
rapid glance. We left the spot. Half-way home, the ardour of my
search became assuaged; and a thought of the problematical object, so
negligently dropped into the box among the cocoons, flashed across my
mind.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" I said to myself. "Suppose it were <i>that?</i> Why not? But, no,
yes, it <i>is</i> that; that's just what it is!"</p>

<p>Then, suddenly turning to Émile, who was rather surprised by this
soliloquy:</p>

<p>"My boy," I said, "you have had a magnificent find. It's a
pseudochrysalis of the Meloidæ. It's a document of incalculable
value; you've struck a fresh vein in the <a name="page146"></a>extraordinary records of
these creatures. Let us look at it closely and at once."</p>

<p>The thing was taken from the box, dusted by blowing on it and
carefully examined. I really had before my eyes the pseudochrysalis
of some Meloid. Its shape was unfamiliar to me. No matter: I was an
old hand and could not mistake its source. Everything assured me that
I was on the track of an insect that rivalled the Sitares and the
Oil-beetles in the strangeness of its transformations; and, what was
a still more precious fact, its occurrence amid the burrows of the
Mantis-killer told me that its habits would be wholly different.</p>

<p>"It's very hot, my poor Émile; we are both of us pretty done. Never
mind: let's go back to our sand-hill and dig and have another search.
I must have the larva that comes before the pseudochrysalis; I must,
if possible, have the insect that comes out of it."</p>

<p>Success responded amply to our zeal. We found a goodly number of
pseudochrysalids. More often still, we unearthed larvæ which were
busy eating the Mantes, the rations of the Tachytes. Are these really
the larvæ that turn into the pseudochrysalids? It seems very
probable, but there is room for <a name="page147"></a>doubt. Rearing them at home will
dispel the mists of probability and replace them by the light of
certainty. But that is all: I have not a vestige of the perfect
insect to inform me of the nature of the parasite. The future, let us
hope, will fill this gap. Such was the result of the first trench
opened in the heap of sand. Later searches enriched my harvest a
little, without furnishing me with fresh data.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to examine my double find. And first of all the
pseudochrysalis, which put me on the alert. It is a motionless, rigid
body, of a waxen yellow, smooth, shiny, curved like a fish-hook
towards the head, which is inflected. Under a very powerful
magnifying-glass the surface is seen to be strewn with very tiny
points which are slightly raised and shinier than the surface. There
are thirteen segments, including the head. The dorsal surface is
convex, the ventral surface flat. A blunt ridge divides the two
surfaces. The three thoracic segments bear each a pair of tiny
conical nipples, of a deep rusty red, signs of the future legs. The
stigmata are very distinct, appearing as specks of a deeper red than
the rest of the integuments. There is one pair, the largest, on the
second segment of the thorax, almost <a name="page148"></a>on the line dividing it from the
first segment. Then follow eight pairs, one on each segment of the
abdomen except the last, making in all nine pairs of stigmata. The
last pair, that of the eighth abdominal segment, is the smallest.</p>

<p>The anal extremity displays no peculiarity. The cephalic mask
comprises eight cone-shaped tubercles, dark red like the tubercles of
the legs. Six of these are arranged in two lateral rows; the others
are between the two rows. In each row of three nipples, the one in
the middle is the largest; it no doubt corresponds with the
mandibles. The length of this organism varies greatly, fluctuating
between 8 and 15 millimetres.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> Its width is from 3 to 4
millimetres.<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> .312 to .585 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> .117 to .156 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Apart from the general configuration, it will be seen that we have
here the strikingly characteristic appearance of the pseudochrysalids
of the Sitares, Oil-beetles and Zonites. There are the same rigid
integuments, of the red of a cough-lozenge or virgin wax; the same
cephalic mask, in which the future mouth-parts are represented by
faintly marked tubercles; the same thoracic studs, which are the
vestiges of the legs; the <a name="page149"></a>same distribution of the stigmata. I was
therefore firmly convinced that the parasite of the Mantis-hunters
could only be a Meloid.</p>

<p>Let us also record the description of the strange larva found
devouring the heap of Mantes in the burrows of the Tachytes. It is
naked, blind, white, soft and sharply curved. Its general appearance
suggests the larva of some Weevil. I should be even more accurate if
I compared it with the secondary larva of <i>Meloe cicatricosus</i>, of
which I once published a drawing in the <i>Annales des sciences
naturelles</i>.<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> If we reduce the dimensions considerably, we shall
have something very like the parasite of the Tachytes.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> It was his essays in this periodical, on the
metamorphoses of the Sitares and Oil-beetles, that procured Fabre his
first reputation as an entomologist.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The head is large, faintly tinged with red. The mandibles are strong,
bent into a pointed hook, black at the tip and a fiery red at the
base. The antennæ are very short, inserted close to the root of the
mandibles. I count three joints: the first thick and globular, the
other two cylindrical, the second of these cut short abruptly. There
are twelve segments, apart from the head, divided by fairly <a name="page150"></a>definite
grooves. The first thoracic segment is a little longer than the rest,
with the dorsal plate very slightly tinged with russet, as is the top
of the head. Beginning with the tenth segment, the body tapers a
little. A slight scalloped rim divides the dorsal from the ventral
surface.</p>

<p>The legs are short, white and transparent and end in a feeble claw. A
pair of stigmata on the mesothorax, near the line of junction with
the prothorax; a stigma on either side of the first eight abdominal
segments; in all nine pairs of stigmata, distributed like those of
the pseudochrysalis. These stigmata are small, tinged with red and
rather difficult to distinguish. Varying in size, like the
pseudochrysalid which seems to come from it, this larva averages
nearly half an inch in length and an eighth of an inch in width.</p>

<p>The six little legs, feeble though they be, perform services which
one would not at first suspect. They embrace the Mantis that is being
devoured and hold her under the mandibles, while the grub, lying on
its side, takes its meal at its ease. They also serve for locomotion.
On a firm surface, such as the wooden top of my table, the larva can
move about quite well; it toddles along, <a name="page151"></a>dragging its belly, with its
body straight from end to end. On fine, loose sand, change of
position becomes difficult. The grub now bends itself into a bow; it
wriggles upon its back, upon its side; it crawls a little way; it
digs and heaves with its mandibles. But let a less crumbling support
come to its assistance; and pilgrimages of some length are not beyond
its powers.</p>

<p>I reared my guests in a box divided into compartments by means of
paper partitions. Each space, representing about the capacity of a
Tachytes-cell, received its layer of sand, its pile of Mantes and its
larva. And more than one disturbance arose in this refectory, where I
had reckoned upon keeping the banqueters isolated one from the other,
each at its special table. This larva, which had finished its ration
the day before, was discovered next day in another chamber, where it
was sharing its neighbour's repast. It had therefore climbed the
partition, which for that matter was of no great height, or else had
forced its way through some chink. This is enough, I think, to prove
that the grub is not a strict stay-at-home, as are the larvæ of the
Sitares and the Oil-beetles when devouring the ration of the
Anthophora.</p>

<p>I imagine that, in the burrows of the <a name="page152"></a>Tachytes, the grub, when its
heap of Mantes is consumed, moves from cell to cell until it has
satisfied its appetite. Its subterranean excursions cannot cover a
wide range, but they enable it to visit a few adjacent cells. I have
mentioned how greatly the Tachytes' provision of Mantes varies.<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small>
The smaller rations certainly fall to the males, which are puny
dwarfs compared with their companions; the more plentiful fall to the
females. The parasitic grub to which fate has allotted the scanty
masculine ration has not perhaps sufficient with this share; it wants
an extra portion, which it can obtain by changing its cell. If it be
favoured by chance, it will eat according to the measure of its
hunger and will attain the full development of which its race allows;
if it wander about without finding anything, it will fast and will
remain small. This would explain the differences which I note in both
the grubs and the pseudochrysalids, differences amounting in linear
dimensions to a hundred per cent and more. The rations, rare or
abundant according to the cells lit upon, would determine the size of
the parasite.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> The essay on the Tachytes has not yet appeared in
English. It will form part of a volume entitled <i>More Hunting
Wasps</i>.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>During the active period, the larva <a name="page153"></a>undergoes a few moults; I have
witnessed at least one of these. The creature stripped of its skin
appears as it was before, without any change of form. It instantly
resumes its meal, which was interrupted while the old skin was shed;
it embraces with its legs another Mantis on the heap and proceeds to
nibble her. Whether simple or multiple, this moult has nothing in
common with the renewals due to the hypermetamorphosis, which so
profoundly change the creature's appearance.</p>

<p>Ten days' rearing in the partitioned box is enough to prove how right
I was when I looked upon the parasitic larva feeding on Mantes as the
origin of the pseudochrysalis, the object of my eager attention. The
creature, which I kept supplied with additional food as long as it
accepted it, stops eating at last. It becomes motionless, retracts
its head slightly and bends itself into a hook. Then the skin splits
across the head and down the thorax. The tattered slough is thrust
back; and the pseudochrysalis appears in sight, absolutely naked. It
is white at first, as the larva was; but by degrees and fairly
rapidly it turns to the russet hue of virgin wax, with a brighter red
at the tips of the various tubercles which indicate the <a name="page154"></a>future legs
and mouth-parts. This shedding of the skin, which leaves the body of
the pseudochrysalis uncovered, recalls the mode of transformation
observed in the Oil-beetles and is different from that of the Sitares
and the Zonites, whose pseudochrysalis remains wholly enveloped in
the skin of the secondary larva, a sort of bag which is sometimes
loose, sometimes tight and always unbroken.</p>

<p>The mist that surrounded us at the outset is dispelled. This is
indeed a Meloid, a true Meloid, one of the strangest anomalies among
the parasites of its tribe. Instead of living on the honey of a Bee,
it feeds on the skewerful of Mantes provided by a Tachytes. The
North-American naturalists have taught us lately that honey is not
always the diet of the Blister-beetles: some Meloidæ in the United
States devour the packets of eggs laid by the Grasshoppers. This is a
legitimate acquisition on their part, not an illegal seizure of the
food-stores of others. No one, as far as I am aware, had as yet
suspected the true parasitism of a carnivorous Meloid. It is
nevertheless very remarkable to find in the Blister-beetles, on both
sides of the Atlantic, this weakness for the flavour of Locust: one
devours her eggs; the <a name="page155"></a>other a representative of the order, in the
shape of the Praying Mantis and her kin.</p>

<p>Who will explain to me this predilection for the Orthopteron in a
tribe whose chief, the Oil-beetle, accepts nothing but the mess of
honey? Why do insects which appear close together in all our
classifications possess such opposite tastes? If they spring from a
common stock, how did the consumption of flesh supplant the
consumption of honey? How did the Lamb become a Wolf? This is the
great problem which was once set us, in an inverse form, by the
Spotted Sapyga, a honey-eating relative of the flesh-eating Scolia.<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small>
I submit the question to whom it may concern.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> The essays on these will appear in the volume, entitled
<i>The Hunting Wasps</i>, aforementioned.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The following year, at the beginning of June, some of my
pseudochrysalids split open transversely behind the head and
lengthwise down the whole of the median line of the back, except the
last two or three segments. From it emerges the tertiary larva,
which, from a simple examination with the pocket-lens, appears to me,
in its general features, identical with the secondary larva, the one
which eats the Tachytes' provisions. It is naked and pale-yellow, the
colour of butter. <a name="page156"></a>It is active and wriggles with awkward movements.
Ordinarily it lies upon its side, but it can also stand in the normal
position. The creature is then trying to use its legs, without
finding sufficient purchase to enable it to walk. A few days later,
it relapses into complete repose.</p>

<p>Thirteen segments, including the head, which is large, with a
quadrilateral cranium, rounded at the sides. Short antennæ,
consisting of three knotted joints. Powerful curved mandibles, with
two or three little teeth at the end, of a fairly bright red. Labial
palpi rather bulky, short and with three joints, like the antennæ.
The mouth-parts, labrum, mandibles and palpi are movable and stir
slightly, as though seeking food. A small brown speck near the base
of each antenna, marking the place of the future eyes. Prothorax
wider than the segments that come after it. These are all of one
width and are distinctly divided by a furrow and a slight lateral
rim. Legs short, transparent, without a terminal claw. They are
three-jointed stumps. Pale stigmata, eight pairs of them, placed as
in the pseudochrysalis, that is, the first and largest pair on the
line dividing the first two segments of the thorax and the seven
others on the first seven <a name="page157"></a>abdominal segments. The secondary larva and
the pseudochrysalis also have a very small stigma on the penultimate
segment of the abdomen. This stigma has disappeared in the tertiary
larva; at least I cannot detect it with the aid of a good
magnifying-glass.</p>

<p>Lastly, we find the same strong mandibles as in the secondary larva,
the same feeble legs, the same appearance of a Weevil-grub. The
movements return, but are less clearly marked than in the primary
form. The passage through the pseudochrysalid state has led to no
change that is really worth describing. The creature, after this
singular phase, is what it was before. The Meloes and Sitares, for
that matter, behave similarly.</p>

<p>Then what can be the meaning of this pseudochrysalid stage, which,
when passed, leads precisely to the point of departure? The Meloid
seems to be revolving in a circle: it undoes what it has just done,
it draws back after advancing. The idea sometimes occurs to me to
look upon the pseudochrysalis as a sort of egg of a superior
organization, starting from which the insect follows the ordinary law
of entomological phases and passes through the successive stages of
larva, nymph and perfect insect. The first hatching, that of the
normal egg, <a name="page158"></a>makes the Meloid go through the larval dimorphism of the
Anthrax and the Leucospis. The primary larva finds its way to the
victuals; the secondary larva consumes them. The second hatching,
that of the pseudochrysalis, reverts to the usual course, so that the
insect passes through the three customary forms: larva, nymph, adult.</p>

<p>The tertiary larval stage is of brief duration, lasting about a
fortnight. The larva then sheds its skin by a longitudinal rent along
the back, as did the secondary larva, uncovering the nymph, in which
we recognize the Beetle, the genus and species being almost
determinable by the antennæ.</p>

<p>The second year's development turned out badly. The few nymphs which
I obtained about the middle of June shrivelled up without attaining
the perfect form. Some pseudochrysalids remained on my hands without
showing any sign of approaching transformation. I attributed this
delay to lack of warmth. I was in fact keeping them in the shade, on
a what-not, in my study, whereas under natural conditions they are
exposed to the hottest sun, beneath a layer of sand a few inches
deep. To imitate these conditions without burying my charges, whose
progress I wished to follow comfortably, I <a name="page159"></a>placed the
pseudochrysalids that remained on a layer of fresh sand at the bottom
of a glass receiver. Direct exposure to the sun was impracticable: it
would have been fatal at a period when life is subterranean. To avoid
it, I tied over the mouth of the receiver a few thicknesses of black
cloth, to represent the natural screen of sand; and the apparatus
thus prepared was exposed for some weeks to the most brilliant
sunshine in my window. Under the cloth cover, which, owing to its
colour, favours the absorption of heat, the temperature, during the
day-time, became that of an oven; and yet the pseudochrysalids
persisted in remaining stationary. The end of July was near and
nothing indicated a speedy hatching. Convinced that my attempts at
heating would be fruitless, I replaced the pseudochrysalids in the
shade, on the shelves, in glass tubes. Here they passed a second
year, still in the same condition.</p>

<p>June returned once more and with it the appearance of the tertiary
larva, followed by the nymph. For the second time this stage of
development was not exceeded; the one and only nymph that I succeeded
in obtaining shrivelled, like those of the year before. Will these
two failures, arising no <a name="page160"></a>doubt from the overdry atmosphere of my
receivers, conceal from us the genus and the species of the
Mantis-eating Meloid? Fortunately, no. The riddle is easily solved by
deduction and comparison.</p>

<p>The only Melodiæ in my part of the country which, though their habits
are still unknown, might correspond in size with either the larva or
the pseudochrysalis in question are the Twelve-pointed Mylabris and
Schaeffer's Cerocoma. I find the first in July on the flowers of the
sea scabious; I find the second at the end of May and in June on the
heads of the Îles d'Hyères everlasting. This last date is best-suited
to explain the presence of the parasitic larva and its
pseudochrysalis in the Tachytes' burrows from July onwards. Moreover,
the Cerocoma is very abundant in the neighbourhood of the sand-heaps
haunted by the Tachytes, while the Mylabris does not occur there. Nor
is this all: the few nymphs obtained have curious antennæ, ending in
a full, irregular tuft, the like of which is found only in the
antennæ of the male Cerocoma. The Mylabris, therefore, must be
eliminated; the antennæ, in the nymph, must be regularly jointed, as
they are in the perfect insect. There remains the Cerocoma.</p>
<a name="page161"></a>
<p>Any lingering doubts may be dispelled: by good fortune, a friend of
mine, Dr. Beauregard, who is preparing a masterly work upon the
Blister-beetles, had some pseudochrysalids of Schreber's Cerocoma in
his possession. Having visited Sérignan for the purpose of scientific
investigations, he had searched the Tachytes' sand-heaps in my
company and taken back to Paris a few pseudochrysalids of grubs fed
on Mantes, in order to follow their development. His attempts, like
mine, had miscarried; but, on comparing the Sérignan pseudochrysalids
with those of Schreber's Cerocoma, which came from Aramon, near
Avignon, he was able to establish the closest resemblance between the
two organisms. Everything therefore confirms the supposition that my
discovery can relate only to Schaeffer's Cerocoma. As for the other,
it must be eliminated: its extreme rarity in my neighbourhood is a
sufficient reason.</p>

<p>It is tiresome that the diet of the Aramon Meloid is not known. If I
allowed myself to be guided by analogy, I should be inclined to
regard Schreber's Cerocoma as a parasite of <i>Tachytes tarsina</i>, who
buries her hoards of young Locusts in the high sandy banks. In that
case, the two Cerocomæ <a name="page162"></a>would have a similar diet. But I leave it to
Dr. Beauregard to elucidate this important characteristic.</p>

<p>The riddle is deciphered: the Meloid that eats Praying Mantes is
Schaeffer's Cerocoma, of whom I find plenty, in the spring, on the
blossoms of the everlasting. Whenever I see it, my attention is
attracted by an unusual peculiarity: the great difference of size
that is able to exist between one specimen and another, albeit of the
same sex. I see stunted creatures, females as well as males, which
are barely one third the length of their better-developed companions.
The Twelve-spotted Mylabris and the Four-spotted Mylabris present
differences quite as pronounced in this respect.</p>

<p>The cause which makes a dwarf or a giant of the same insect,
irrespective of its sex, can be only the smaller or greater quantity
of food. If the larva, as I suspect, is obliged to find the Tachytes'
game-larder for itself and to visit a second and a third, when the
first is too frugally furnished, it may be imagined that the hazard
of the road does not favour all in the same way, but rather allots
abundance to one and penury to another. The grub that does not eat
its fill remains small, while the one that gluts itself <a name="page163"></a>grows fat.
These differences of size, in themselves, betray parasitism. If a
mother's pains had amassed the food, or if the family had had the
industry to obtain it direct instead of robbing others, the ration
would be practically equal for all; and the inequalities in size
would be reduced to those which often occur between the two sexes.</p>

<p>They speak, moreover, of a precarious, risky parasitism, wherein the
Meloid is not sure of finding its food, which the Sitaris finds so
deftly, getting itself carried by the Anthophora, after being born at
the very entrance to the Bee's galleries and leaving its retreat only
to slip into its host's fleece. A vagabond obliged to find for itself
the food that suits it, the Cerocoma incurs the risk of Lenten fare.</p>

<p>One chapter is lacking to complete the history of Schaeffer's
Cerocoma: that which treats of the beginning, the laying of the eggs,
the egg itself and the primary larva. While watching the development
of the Mantis-eating parasite, I took my precautions, in the first
year, to discover its starting-point. By eliminating what was known
to me and seeking among the Meloidæ of my neighbourhood for the size
that corresponded with the pseudochrysalids unearthed from the
<a name="page164"></a>Tachytes' burrows, I found, as I have said, only Schaeffer's Cerocoma
and the Twelve-spotted Mylabris. I undertook to rear these in order
to obtain their eggs.</p>

<p>As a standard of comparison, the Four-spotted Mylabris, of a more
imposing size, was added to the first two. A fourth, <i>Zonitis
mutica</i>, whom I did not need to consult, knowing that she was not
connected with the matter in hand and being familiar with her
pseudochrysalis, completed my school of egg-layers. I proposed, if
possible, to obtain her primary larva. Lastly, I had formerly reared
some Cantharides with the object of observing their egg-laying. In
all, five species of Blister-beetles, reared in a breeding-cage, have
left a few lines of notes in my records.</p>

<p>The method of rearing is of the simplest. Each species is placed
under a large wire-gauze dome standing in a basin filled with earth.
In the middle of the enclosure is a bottle full of water, in which
the food soaks and keeps fresh. For the Cantharides, this is a bundle
of ash-twigs; for the Four-spotted Mylabris, a bunch of bindweed
(<i>Convolvus arvensis</i>) or psoralea (<i>P. biluminosa</i>), of which the
insect nibbles only the corollæ. For the Twelve-spotted Mylabris, I
provide <a name="page165"></a>blossoms of the scabious (<i>Scabiosa maritima</i>); for the
Zonitis, the full-blown heads of the eryngo (<i>Eryngium campestre</i>);
for Schaeffer's Cerocoma, the heads of the Îles d'Hyères everlasting
(<i>Helichrysum stoechas</i>). These three last nibble more particularly
the anthers, more rarely the petals, never the leaves.</p>

<p>A sorry intellect and sorry manners, which hardly repay the minute
cares involved in the rearing. To browse, to love her lord, to dig a
hole in the earth and carelessly to bury her eggs in it: that is the
whole life of the adult Meloid. The dull creature acquires a little
interest only at the moment when the male begins to toy with his
mate. Every species has its own ritual in declaring its passion; and
it is not beneath the dignity of the observer to witness the
manifestations, sometimes so very strange, of the universal Eros, who
rules the world and brings a tremor to even the lowest of the brute
creation. This is the ultimate aim of the insect, which becomes
transfigured for this solemn function and then dies, having no more
to do.</p>

<p>A curious book might be written on the subject of love among the
beasts. Long ago the subject tempted me. For a quarter of a century
my notes have been slumbering, <a name="page166"></a>dustily, in a corner of my library. I
extract from them the following details concerning the Cantharides. I
am not the first, I know, to describe the amorous preludes of the
Meloid of the Ash-tree; but the change of narrator may give the
narrative a certain value: it confirms what has already been said and
throws light upon some points which may have escaped notice.</p>

<p>A female Cantharides is peacefully nibbling her leaf. A lover comes
upon the scene, approaches her from behind, suddenly mounts upon her
back and embraces her with his two pairs of hind-legs. Then with his
abdomen, which he lengthens as much as possible, he energetically
slaps that of the female, on the right side and the left by turns. It
is like the strokes of a washerwoman's bat, delivered with frenzied
rapidity. With his antennæ and his fore-legs, which remain free, he
furiously lashes the neck of the victim. While the blows fall thick
as hail, in front and behind, the head and corselet of the amorous
swain are shaken by an extravagant swaying and trembling. You would
think that the creature was having an epileptic fit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the beloved makes herself small, opening her wing-cases
slightly, hiding <a name="page167"></a>her head and tucking her abdomen under her, as
though to escape the erotic thunderstorm that is bursting upon her
back. But the paroxysm calms down. The male extends his fore-legs,
shaken by a nervous tremor, like the arms of a cross and in this
ecstatic posture seems to call upon the heavens to witness the ardour
of his desires. The antennæ and the belly are held motionless, in a
straight line; the head and the corselet alone continue to heave
rapidly up and down. This period of repose does not last long. Short
as it is, the female, her appetite undisturbed by the passionate
protestations of her wooer, imperturbably resumes the nibbling of her
leaf.</p>

<p>Another paroxysm bursts forth. Once more the male's blows rain upon
the neck of the tightly-clasped victim, who hastens to bow her head
upon her breast. But he has no intention of allowing his lady-love to
escape. With his fore-legs, using a special notch placed at the
juncture of the leg and the tarsus, he seizes both her antennæ. The
tarsus folds back; and the antennæ are held as in a vice. The suitor
pulls; and the callous one is forced to raise her head. In this
posture the male reminds one of a horseman proudly sitting his steed
and holding the <a name="page168"></a>reins in both hands. Thus mastering his mount, he is
sometimes motionless and sometimes frenzied in his demonstrations.
Then, with his long abdomen, he lashes the female's hinder-parts,
first on one side, then on the other; the front part he flogs,
hammers and pounds with blows of his antennæ, head and feet. The
object of his desires will be unfeeling indeed if she refuse to
surrender to so passionate a declaration.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she still requires entreating. The impassioned lover
resumes his ecstatic immobility, with his quivering arms outstretched
like the limbs of a cross. At brief intervals the amorous outbursts,
with blows conscientiously distributed, recur in alternation with
periods of repose, during which the male holds his fore-legs
crosswise, or else masters the female by the bridle of her antennæ.
At last the flagellated beauty allows herself to be touched by the
charm attendant on his thumps. She yields. Coupling takes place and
lasts for twenty hours. The heroic part of the male's performance is
over. Dragged backwards behind the female, the poor fellow strives to
uncouple himself. His mate carts him about from leaf to leaf,
wherever she pleases, so that she may choose the bit of green stuff
to her taste. Sometimes he <a name="page169"></a>also takes a gallant resolve and, like the
female, begins to browse. You lucky creatures, who, so as not to lose
a moment of your four or five weeks' existence, yoke together the
cravings of love and hunger! Your motto is, "A short life and a merry
one."</p>

<p>The Cerocoma, who is a golden green like the Cantharides, seems to
have partly adopted the amorous rites of her rival in dress. The
male, always the elegant sex in the insect tribe, wears special
ornaments. The horns or antennæ, magnificently complicated, form as
it were two tufts of a thick head of hair. It is to this that the
name Cerocoma refers: the creature crested with its horns. When a
bright sun shines into the breeding-cage, it is not long before the
insects form couples on the bunch of everlastings. Hoisted on the
female, whom he embraces and holds with his two pairs of hind-legs,
the male sways his head and corselet up and down, all in a piece.
This oscillatory movement has not the fiery precipitation of that of
the Cantharides; it is calmer and as it were rhythmical. The abdomen
moreover remains motionless and seems unskilled in those slaps, as of
a washerwoman's bat, which the amorous denizen of the ash-tree so
vigorously distributes with his belly.</p>
<a name="page170"></a>
<p>While the front half of the body swings up and down, the fore-legs
execute magnetic passes on either side of the tight-clasped female,
moving with a sort of twirl, so rapidly that the eye can hardly
follow them. The female appears insensible to this flagellatory
twirl. She innocently curls her antennæ. The rejected suitor leaves
her and moves on to another. His dizzy, twirling passes, his
protestations are everywhere refused. The moment has not yet arrived,
or rather the spot is not propitious. Captivity appears to weigh upon
the future mothers. Before listening to their wooers they must have
the open air, the sudden joyful flight from cluster to cluster on the
sunlit slope, all gold with everlastings. Apart from the idyll of the
twirling passes, a mitigated form of the Cantharides' blows, the
Cerocoma refused to yield before my eyes to the last act of the
bridal.</p>

<p>Among males the same oscillations of the body and the same lateral
flagellations are frequently practised. While the upper one makes a
tremendous to-do and whirls his legs, the one under him keeps quiet.
Sometimes a third scatterbrain comes on the scene, sometimes even a
fourth, and mounts upon the heap of his predecessors. The uppermost
<a name="page171"></a>bobs up and down and makes swift rowing-strokes with his fore-legs;
the others remain motionless. Thus are the sorrows of the rejected
beguiled for a moment.</p>

<p>The Zonites, a rude clan, grazing on the heads of the prickly eryngo,
despise all tender preliminaries. A few rapid vibrations of the
antennæ on the males' part; and that is all. The declaration could
not be briefer. The pairing, with the creatures placed end to end,
lasts nearly an hour.</p>

<p>The Mylabres also must be very expeditious in their preliminaries, so
much so that my cages, which were kept well-stocked for two summers,
provided me with numerous batches of eggs without giving me a single
opportunity of catching the males in the least bit of a flirtation.
Let us therefore consider the egg-laying.</p>

<p>This takes place in August for our two species of Mylabres. In the
vegetable mould which does duty as a floor to the wire-gauze dome,
the mother digs a pit four-fifths of an inch deep and as wide as her
body. This is the place for the eggs. The laying lasts barely half an
hour. I have seen it last thirty-six hours with Sitares. This
quickness of the Mylabris points to an incomparably less numerous
family. The hiding-place is <a name="page172"></a>next closed. The mother sweeps up the
rubbish with her fore-legs, collects it with the rake of her
mandibles and pushes it back into the pit, into which she now
descends to stamp upon the powdery layer and cram it down with her
hind-legs, which I see swiftly working. When this layer is well
packed, she starts raking together fresh material to complete the
filling of the hole, which is carefully trampled stratum by stratum.</p>

<p>I take the mother from her pit while she is engaged in filling it up.
Delicately, with the tip of a camel-hair pencil, I move her a couple
of inches. The Beetle does not return to her batch of eggs, does not
even look for it. She climbs up the wire gauze and proceeds to graze
among her companions on the bindweed or scabious, without troubling
herself further about her eggs, whose hiding-place is only
half-filled. A second mother, whom I move only one inch, is no longer
able to return to her task, or rather does not think of doing so. I
take a third, after shifting her just as slightly, and, while the
forgetful creature is climbing up the trellis-work, bring her back to
the pit. I replace her with her head at the opening. The mother
stands motionless, looking thoroughly perplexed. She sways her head,
passes her front tarsi <a name="page173"></a>through her mandibles, then moves away and
climbs to the top of the dome without attempting anything. In each of
these three cases I have to finish filling in the pit myself. What
then are this maternity, which the touch of a brush causes to forget
its duties, and this memory, which is lost at a distance of an inch
from the spot? Compare with these shortcomings of the adult the
expert machinations of the primary larva, which knows where its
victuals are and as its first action introduces itself into the
dwelling of the host that is to feed it. How can time and experience
be factors of instinct? The newborn animalcule amazes us with its
foresight; the adult insect astonishes us with its stupidity.</p>

<p>With both Mylabres, the batch consists of some forty eggs, a very
small number compared with those of the Oil-beetle and the Sitaris.
This limited family was already foreseen, judging by the short space
of time which the egg-layer spends in her underground lodging. The
eggs of the Twelve-spotted Mylabris are white, cylindrical, rounded
at both ends and measure a millimetre and a half in length by half a
millimetre in width.<small><small><sup>6</sup></small></small> Those of the Four-spotted <a name="page174"></a>Mylabris are straw
coloured and of an elongated oval, a trifle fuller at one end than at
the other. Length, two millimetres; width, a little under one
millimetre.<small><small><sup>7</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>6</sup></small> .058 x .019 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>7</sup></small> .078 x .039 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Of all the batches of eggs collected, one alone hatched. The rest
were probably sterile, a suspicion corroborated by the lack of
pairing in the breeding-cage. Laid at the end of July, the eggs of
the Twelve-spotted Mylabris began to hatch on the 5th of September.
The primary larva of this Meloid is still unknown, so far as I am
aware; and I shall describe it in detail. It will be the
starting-point of a chapter which perhaps will give us some fresh
sidelights upon the history of the hypermetamorphosis.</p>

<p>The larva is nearly 2 millimetres long.<small><small><sup>8</sup></small></small> Coming out of a good-sized
egg, it is endowed with greater vigour than the larvæ of the Sitares
and Oil-beetles. The head is large, rounded, slightly wider than the
prothorax and of a rather brighter red. Mandibles powerful, sharp,
curved, with the ends crossing, of the same colour as the head,
darker at the tips. Eyes black, prominent, globular, very distinct.
Antennæ fairly long, <a name="page175"></a>with three joints, the last thinner and pointed.
Palpi very much pronounced.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>8</sup></small> .078 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The first thoracic segment has very nearly the same diameter as the
head and is much longer than those which come after. It forms a sort
of cuirass equal in length to almost three abdominal segments. It is
squared off in front in a straight line and is rounded at the sides
and at the back. Its colour is bright red. The second ring is hardly
a third as long as the first. It is also red, but a little browner.
The third is dark brown, with a touch of green to it. This tint is
repeated throughout the abdomen, so that in the matter of colouring
the creature is divided into two sections: the front, which is a
fairly bright red, includes the head and the first two thoracic
segments; the second, which is a greenish brown, includes the third
thoracic segment and the nine abdominal rings.</p>

<p>The three pairs of legs are pale red, strong and long, considering
the creature's smallness. They end in a single long, sharp claw.</p>

<p>The abdomen has nine segments, all of an olive brown. The membranous
spaces which connect them are white, so that, from the second
thoracic ring downwards, the tiny creature is alternatively ringed
with white <a name="page176"></a>and olive brown. All the brown rings bristle with short,
sparse hairs. The anal segment, which is narrower than the rest,
bears at the tip two long cirri, very fine, slightly waved and almost
as long as the whole abdomen.</p>

<p>This description enables us to picture a sturdy little creature,
capable of biting lustily with its mandibles, exploring the country
with its big eyes and moving about with six strong harpoons as a
support. We no longer have to do with the puny louse of the
Oil-beetle, which lies in ambush on a cichoriaceous blossom in order
to slip into the fleece of a harvesting Bee; nor with the black atom
of the Sitaris, which swarms in a heap on the spot where it is
hatched, at the Anthophora's door. I see the young Mylabris striding
eagerly up and down the glass tube in which it was born.</p>

<p>What is it seeking? What does it want? I give it a Bee, a
Halictus,<small><small><sup>9</sup></small></small> to see if it will settle on the insect, as the Sitares
and Oil-beetles would not fail to do. My offer is scorned. It is not
a winged conveyance that my prisoners require.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>9</sup></small> Cf. <i>Bramble-bees and Others:</i> chaps. xii. to
xiv.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The primary larva of the Mylabris <a name="page177"></a>therefore does not imitate those of
the Sitaris and the Oil-beetle; it does not settle in the fleece of
its host to get itself carried to the cell crammed with victuals. The
task of seeking and finding the heap of food falls upon its own
shoulders. The small number of the eggs that constitute a batch also
leads to the same conclusion. Remember that the primary larva of the
Oil-beetle, for instance, settles on any insect that happens to pay a
momentary visit to the flower in which the tiny creature is on the
look-out. Whether this visitor be hairy or smooth-skinned, a
manufacturer of honey, a canner of animal flesh or without any
determined calling, whether she be Spider, Butterfly, Fly or Beetle
makes no difference: the instant the little yellow louse espies the
new arrival, it perches on her back and leaves with her. And now it
all depends on luck! How many of these stray travellers must be lost;
how many will never be carried into a warehouse full of honey, their
sole food! Therefore, to remedy this enormous waste, the mother
produces an innumerable family. The Oil-beetle's batch of eggs is
prodigious. Prodigious too is that of the Sitaris, who is exposed to
similar misadventures.</p>

<p>If, with her thirty or forty eggs, the <a name="page178"></a>Mylabris had to run the same
risks, perhaps not one larva would reach the desired goal. For so
strictly limited a family a safer method is needed. The young larva
must not get itself carried to the game-basket, or more probably to
the honey-pot, at the risk of never reaching it; it must travel on
its own legs. Allowing myself to be guided by the logic of things, I
shall therefore complete the story of the Twelve-spotted Mylabris as
follows.</p>

<p>The mother lays her eggs underground near the spots frequented by the
foster-mothers. The recently-hatched young grubs leave their lodgings
in September and travel within a restricted radius in search of
burrows containing food. The little creature's sturdy legs allow of
these underground investigations. The mandibles, which are just as
strong, necessarily play their part. The parasite, on forcing its way
into the food-pit, finds itself faced with either the egg or the
young larva of the Bee. These are competitors, whom it is important
to get rid of as quickly as possible. The hooks of the mandibles now
come into play, tearing the egg or the defenceless grub. After this
act of brigandage, which may be compared with that of the primary
larva of the Sitaris <a name="page179"></a>ripping open and drinking the contents of the
Anthophora's egg, the Meloid, now the sole possessor of the victuals,
doffs its battle array and becomes the pot-bellied grub, the consumer
of the property so brutally acquired. These are merely suspicions on
my part, nothing more. Direct observation will, I believe, confirm
them, so close is their connection with the known facts.</p>

<p>Two Zonites, both visitors of the eryngo-heads during the heats of
summer, are among the Meloidæ of my part of the country. They are
<i>Zonitis mutica</i> and <i>Z. præusta</i>. I have spoken of the first in
another volume;<small><small><sup>10</sup></small></small> I have mentioned its pseudochrysalis found in the
cells of two Osmiæ, namely, the Three-pronged Osmia, which piles its
cells in a dry bramble-stem, and the Three-horned Osmia and also
Latreille's Osmia, both of which exploit the nests of the Chalicodoma
of the Sheds. The second Zonitis is to-day adding its quota of
evidence to a story which is still very incomplete. I have obtained
the Burnt Zonitis, in the first place, from the cotton pouches of
<i>Anthidium scapulare</i>, who, like the Three-toothed Osmia, makes her
nests in the brambles; in the second place, from the <a name="page180"></a>wallets of
<i>Megachile sericans</i>, made with little round disks of the leaves of
the common acacia; in the third place, from the cells which
<i>Anthidium bellicosum</i><small><small><sup>11</sup></small></small> builds with partitions of resin in the
shell of a dead Snail. This last Anthidium is the victim also of the
Unarmed Zonitis. Thus we have two closely-related exploiters for the
same victim.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>10</sup></small> Cf. <i>Bramble-bees and Others:</i> chaps. i., iii. and
x.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>11</sup></small> For the Cotton-bee, Leaf-cutter and Resin-bee
mentioned, cf. <i>Bramble-bees and Others:</i> <i>passim</i>.&mdash;<i>Translator's
Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>During the last fortnight of July, I witness the emergence of the
Burnt Zonitis from the pseudochrysalis. The latter is cylindrical,
slightly curved and rounded at both ends. It is closely wrapped in
the cast skin of the secondary larva, a skin consisting of a
diaphanous bag, without any outlet, with running along each side a
white tracheal thread which connects the various stigmatic apertures.
I easily recognize the seven abdominal stigmata; they are round and
diminish slightly in width from front to back. I also detect the
thoracic stigma. Lastly, I perceive the legs, which are quite small,
with weak claws, incapable of supporting the creature. Of the
mouth-parts I see plainly only the mandibles, which are short, weak
and brown. In short, the secondary larva <a name="page181"></a>was soft, white,
big-bellied, blind, with rudimentary legs. Similar results were
furnished by the shed skin of the secondary larva of <i>Zonitis
mutica</i>, consisting, like the other, of a bag without an opening,
fitting closely over the pseudochrysalis.</p>

<p>Let us continue our examination of the relics of the Burnt Zonitis.
The pseudochrysalis is red, the colour of a cough-lozenge. It remains
intact after opening, except in front, where the adult insect has
emerged. In shape it is a cylindrical bag, with firm, elastic walls.
The segmentation is plainly visible. The magnifying-glass shows the
fine star-shaped dots already observed in the Unarmed Zonitis. The
stigmatic apertures have a projecting, dark-red rim. They are all,
even the last, clearly marked. The signs of the legs are mere studs,
hardly protruding, a little darker than the rest of the skin. The
cephalic mask is reduced to a few mouldings which are not easy to
distinguish.</p>

<p>At the bottom of this pseudochrysalidal sheath I find a little white
wad which, when placed in water, softened and then patiently
unravelled with the tip of a paint-brush, yields a white, powdery
substance, which is uric acid, the usual product of the work of <a name="page182"></a>the
nymphosis, and a rumpled membrane, in which I recognize the cast skin
of the nymph. There should still be the tertiary larva, of which I
see not a trace. But, on taking a needle and gradually breaking the
envelope of the pseudochrysalis, after soaking it awhile in water, I
see it dividing into two layers, one an outer layer, brittle, horny
in appearance and currant-red; the other an inner layer, consisting
of a transparent, flexible pellicle. There can be no doubt that this
inner layer represents the tertiary larva, whose skin is left
adhering to the envelope of the pseudochrysalis. It is fairly thick
and tough, but I cannot detach it except in shreds, so closely does
it adhere to the horny, crumbly sheath.</p>

<p>Since I possessed a fair number of pseudochrysalids, I sacrificed a
few in order to ascertain their contents on the approach of the final
transformations. Well, I never found anything that I could detach; I
never succeeded in extracting a larva in its tertiary form, though
this larva is so easily obtained from the amber pouches of the
Sitares and, in the Oil-beetles and Cerocomæ, emerges of its own
accord from the split wrapper of the pseudochrysalis. When, for the
first time, the stiff shell encloses a body which <a name="page183"></a>does not adhere to
the rest, this body is a nymph and nothing else. The wall surrounding
it is a dull white inside. I attribute this colouring to the cast
skin of the tertiary larva, which was inseparably fixed to the shell
of the pseudochrysalis.</p>

<p>The Zonites, therefore, display a peculiarity which is not offered by
the other Meloidæ, namely, a series of tightly-fitting shells, one
within the other. The pseudochrysalis is enclosed in the skin of the
secondary larva, a skin which forms a pouch without an orifice,
fitted very closely to its contents. The slough of the tertiary larva
fits even more closely to the inner surface of the pseudochrysalid
sheath. The nymph alone does not adhere to its envelope. In the
Cerocomæ and the Oil-beetles, each form of the hypermetamorphosis
becomes detached from the preceding skin by a complete extraction;
the contents are removed from the ruptured container and have no
further connection with it. In the Sitares, the successive casts are
not ruptured and remain enclosed inside one another, but with an
interval between, so that the tertiary larva can move and turn as it
wishes in its multiple enclosure. In the Zonites, there is the same
arrangement, with this difference, <a name="page184"></a>that, until the nymph appears,
there is no empty space between one slough and the next. The tertiary
larva cannot budge. It is not free, as witness its cast skin, which
fits so precisely to the envelope of the pseudochrysalis. This form
would therefore pass unperceived if its existence were not proclaimed
by the membrane which lines the inside of the pseudochrysalid pouch.</p>

<p>To complete the story of the Zonites, the primary larva is lacking. I
do not yet know it, for, when rearing the insect under wire-gauze
covers, I never succeeded in obtaining a batch of eggs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<center>THE CAPRICORN</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>My youthful meditations owe some happy moments to Condillac's<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small>
famous statue which, when endowed with the sense of smell, inhales
the scent of a rose and out of that single impression creates a whole
world of ideas. My twenty-year-old mind, full of faith in syllogisms,
loved to follow the deductive jugglery of the abbé-philosopher:
I saw, or seemed to see, the statue take life in that action of the
nostrils, acquiring attention, memory, judgment and all the
psychological paraphernalia, even as still waters are aroused and
rippled by the impact of a grain of sand. I recovered from my
illusion under the instruction of my abler <a name="page186"></a>master, the animal. The
Capricorn shall teach us that the problem is more obscure than the
abbé led me to believe.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, Abbé de Mureaux
(1715-1780), the leading exponent of sensational philosophy. His most
important work is the <i>Traité des sensations</i>, in which he imagines a
statue, organized like a man, and endows it with the senses one by
one, beginning with that of smell. He argues by a process of
imaginative reconstruction that all human faculties and all human
knowledge are merely transformed sensation, to the exclusion of any
other principle, that, in short, everything has its source in
sensation: man is nothing but what he has acquired.&mdash;<i>Translator's

<p>When wedge and mallet are at work, preparing my provision of firewood
under the grey sky that heralds winter, a favourite relaxation
creates a welcome break in my daily output of prose. By my express
orders, the woodman has selected the oldest and most ravaged trunks
in his stack. My tastes bring a smile to his lips; he wonders by what
whimsy I prefer wood that is worm-eaten, <i>chirouna</i>, as he calls it,
to sound wood, which burns so much better. I have my views on the
subject; and the worthy man submits to them.</p>

<p>And now to us two, O my fine oak-trunk seamed with scars, gashed with
wounds whence trickle the brown drops smelling of the tan-yard. The
mallet drives home, the wedges bite, the wood splits. What do your
flanks contain? Real treasures for my studies. In the dry and hollow
parts, groups of various insects, capable of living through the bad
season of the year, have taken up their winter quarters: in the
low-roofed galleries, galleries built by some Buprestis Beetle,
Osmiæ, working their paste of masticated leaves, have piled their
cells one above the <a name="page187"></a>other; in the deserted chambers and vestibules,
Megachiles have arranged their leafy jars; in the live wood, filled
with juicy saps, the larvæ of the Capricorn (<i>Cerambyx miles</i>), the
chief author of the oak's undoing, have set up their home.</p>

<p>Strange creatures, of a verity, are these grubs, for an insect of
superior organization: bits of intestines crawling about! At this
time of year, the middle of autumn, I meet them of two different
ages. The older are almost as thick as one's finger; the others
hardly attain the diameter of a pencil. I find, in addition, pupæ
more or less fully coloured, perfect insects, with a distended
abdomen, ready to leave the trunk when the hot weather comes again.
Life inside the wood, therefore, lasts three years. How is this long
period of solitude and captivity spent? In wandering lazily through
the thickness of the oak, in making roads whose rubbish serves as
food. The horse in Job swallows the ground<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> in a figure of speech;
the Capricorn's grub eats its way literally. With its
carpenter's-gouge, a strong black <a name="page188"></a>mandible, short, devoid of notches,
scooped into a sharp-edged spoon, it digs the opening of its tunnel.
The piece cut out is a mouthful which, as it enters the stomach,
yields its scanty juices and accumulates behind the worker in heaps
of wormed wood. The refuse leaves room in front by passing through
the worker. A labour at once of nutrition and of road-making, the
path is devoured while constructed; it is blocked behind as it makes
way ahead. That, however, is how all the borers who look to wood for
victuals and lodging set about their business.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> "Chafing and raging, he swalloweth the ground, neither
doth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth."&mdash;Job,
xxxix, 23 (Douai version).&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>For the harsh work of its two gouges, or curved chisels, the larva of
the Capricorn concentrates its muscular strength in the front of its
body, which swells into a pestle-head. The Buprestis-grubs, those
other industrious carpenters, adopt a similar form; they even
exaggerate their pestle. The part that toils and carves hard wood
requires a robust structure; the rest of the body, which has but to
follow after, continues slim. The essential thing is that the
implement of the jaws should possess a solid support and a powerful
motor. The Cerambyx-larva strengthens its chisels with a stout,
black, horny armour that surrounds the mouth; yet, <a name="page189"></a>apart from its
skull and its equipment of tools, the grub has a skin as fine as
satin and as white as ivory. This dead white comes from a copious
layer of grease which the animal's spare diet would not lead us to
suspect. True, it has nothing to do, at every hour of the day and
night, but gnaw. The quantity of wood that passes into its stomach
makes up for the dearth of nourishing elements.</p>

<p>The legs, consisting of three pieces, the first globular, the last
sharp-pointed, are mere rudiments, vestiges. They are hardly a
millimetre<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> long. For this reason, they are of no use whatever for
walking; they do not even bear upon the supporting surface, being
kept off it by the obesity of the chest. The organs of locomotion are
something altogether different. The Cetonia-grub<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> has shown us how,
with the aid of the hairs and the pad-like excrescences upon its
spine, it manages to reverse the universally-accepted usage and to
wriggle along on its back. The grub of the Capricorn is even more
ingenious: it moves at the same time on its back <a name="page190"></a>and belly; instead
of the useless legs of the thorax, it has a walking-apparatus almost
resembling feet, which appear, contrary to every rule, on the dorsal
surface.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> .039 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> For the grub of the Cetonia, or Rose-chafer, cf. <i>The
Life and Love of the Insect</i>, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chap. xi.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The first seven segments of the abdomen have, both above and below, a
four-sided facet, bristling with rough protuberances. This the grub
can either expand or contract, making it stick out or lie flat at
will. The upper facets consist of two excrescences separated by the
mid-dorsal line; the lower ones have not this divided appearance.
These are the organs of locomotion, the ambulacra. When the larva
wishes to move forwards, it expands its hinder ambulacra, those on
the back as well as those on the belly, and contracts its front ones.
Fixed to the side of the narrow gallery by their ridges, the
hind-pads give the grub a purchase. The flattening of the fore-pads,
by decreasing the diameter, allows it to slip forward and to take
half a step. To complete the step, the hind-quarters have to be
brought up the same distance. With this object, the front pads fill
out and provide support, while those behind shrink and leave free
scope for their segments to contract.</p>

<p>With the double support of its back and belly, with alternate
puffings and shrinkings, <a name="page191"></a>the animal easily advances or retreats along
its gallery, a sort of mould which the contents fill without a gap.
But, if the locomotory pads grip only on one side, progress becomes
impossible. When placed on the smooth wood of my table, the animal
wriggles slowly; it lengthens and shortens without advancing by a
hair's-breadth. Laid on the surface of a piece of split oak, a rough,
uneven surface, due to the gash made by the wedge, it twists and
writhes, moves the front part of its body very slowly from left to
right and right to left, lifts it a little, lowers it and begins
again. These are the most extensive movements made. The vestigial
legs remain inert and absolutely useless.</p>

<p>Then why are they there? Better to lose them altogether, if it be
true that crawling inside the oak has deprived the animal of the good
legs with which it started. The influence of environment, so
well-inspired in endowing the grub with ambulatory pads, becomes a
mockery when it leaves it these ridiculous stumps. Can the structure,
perchance, be obeying other rules than those of environment?</p>

<p>Though the useless legs, the germs of the future limbs, persist,
there is no sign in the grub of the eyes wherewith the Cerambyx <a name="page192"></a>will
be richly gifted. The larva has not the least trace of organs of
vision. What would it do with sight, in the murky thickness of a
tree-trunk? Hearing is likewise absent. In the never-troubled silence
of the oak's inmost heart, the sense of hearing would be a non-sense.
Where sounds are lacking, of what use is the faculty of discerning
them? Should there be any doubts, I will reply to them with the
following experiment. Split lengthwise, the grub's abode leaves a
half-tunnel wherein I can watch the occupant's doings. When left
alone, it now gnaws the front of its gallery, now rests, fixed by its
ambulacra to the two sides of the channel. I avail myself of these
moments of quiet to enquire into its power of perceiving sounds. The
banging of hard bodies, the ring of metallic objects, the grating of
a file upon a saw are tried in vain. The animal remains impassive.
Not a wince, not a move of the skin; no sign of awakened attention. I
succeed no better when I scratch the wood close by with a hard point,
to imitate the sound of some neighbouring larva gnawing the
intervening thickness. The indifference to my noisy tricks could be
no greater in a lifeless object. The animal is deaf.</p>
<a name="page193"></a>
<p>Can it smell? Everything tells us no. Scent is of assistance in the
search for food. But the Capricorn-grub need not go in quest of
eatables: it feeds on its home, it lives on the wood that gives it
shelter. Let us make an attempt or two, however. I scoop in a log of
fresh cypress-wood a groove of the same diameter as that of the
natural galleries and I place the worm inside it. Cypress-wood is
strongly-scented; it possesses in a high degree that resinous aroma
which characterizes most of the pine family. Well, when laid in the
odoriferous channel, the larva goes to the end, as far as it can go,
and makes no further movement. Does not this placid quiescence point
to the absence of a sense of smell? The resinous flavour, so strange
to the grub which has always lived in oak, ought to vex it, to
trouble it; and the disagreeable impression ought to be revealed by a
certain commotion, by certain attempts to get away. Well, nothing of
the kind happens: once the larva has found the right position in the
groove, it does not stir. I do more: I set before it, at a very short
distance, in its normal canal, a piece of camphor. Again, no effect.
Camphor is followed by naphthaline. Still nothing. After these
<a name="page194"></a>fruitless endeavours, I do not think that I am going too far when I
deny the creature a sense of smell.</p>

<p>Taste is there, no doubt. But such taste! The food is without
variety: oak, for three years at a stretch, and nothing else. What
can the grub's palate appreciate in this monotonous fare? The tannic
relish of a fresh piece, oozing with sap; the uninteresting flavour
of an over-dry piece, robbed of its natural condiment: these probably
represent the whole gustative scale.</p>

<p>There remains touch, the far-spreading passive sense common to all
live flesh that quivers under the goad of pain. The sensitive
schedule of the Cerambyx-grub, therefore, is limited to taste and
touch, both exceedingly obtuse. This almost brings us to Condillac's
statue. The imaginary being of the philosopher had one sense only,
that of smell, equal in delicacy to our own; the real being, the
ravager of the oak, has two, inferior, even when put together, to the
former, which so plainly perceived the scent of a rose and
distinguished it so clearly from any other. The real case will bear
comparison with the fictitious.</p>

<p>What can be the psychology of a creature possessing such a powerful
digestive <a name="page195"></a>organism combined with such a feeble set of senses? A vain
wish has often come to me in my dreams: it is to be able to think,
for a few minutes, with the crude brain of my Dog, to see the world
with the faceted eyes of a Gnat. How things would change in
appearance! They would change much more if interpreted by the
intellect of the grub. What have the lessons of touch and taste
contributed to that rudimentary receptacle of impressions? Very
little; almost nothing. The animal knows that the best bits possess
an astringent flavour; that the sides of a passage not carefully
planed are painful to the skin. This is the utmost limit of its
acquired wisdom. In comparison, the statue with the sensitive
nostrils was a marvel of knowledge, a paragon too generously endowed
by its inventor. It remembered, compared, judged, reasoned: does the
drowsy, digesting paunch remember? Does it compare? Does it reason? I
defined the Capricorn-grub as a bit of an intestine that crawls
about. The undeniable accuracy of this definition provides me with my
answer: the grub has the aggregate of sense-impressions that a bit of
an intestine may hope to have.</p>

<p>And this nothing-at-all is capable of marvellous acts of foresight;
this belly, which <a name="page196"></a>knows hardly anything of the present, sees very
clearly into the future. Let us take an illustration on this curious
subject. For three years on end, the larva wanders about in the thick
of the trunk; it goes up, goes down, turns to this side and that; it
leaves one vein for another of better flavour, but without moving too
far from the inner depths, where the temperature is milder and
greater safety reigns. A day is at hand, a dangerous day for the
recluse obliged to quit its excellent retreat and face the perils of
the surface. Eating is not everything: we have to get out of this.
The larva, so well-equipped with tools and muscular strength, finds
no difficulty in going where it pleases, by boring through the wood;
but does the coming Capricorn, whose short spell of life must be
spent in the open air, possess the same advantages? Hatched inside
the trunk, will the long-horned Beetle be able to clear itself a way
of escape?</p>

<p>That is the difficulty which the worm solves by inspiration. Less
versed in things of the future, despite my gleams of reason, I resort
to experiment with a view to fathoming the question. I begin by
ascertaining that the Capricorn, when he wishes to leave the trunk,
is absolutely unable to make use of <a name="page197"></a>the tunnel wrought by the larva.
It is a very long and very irregular maze, blocked with great heaps
of wormed wood. Its diameter decreases progressively from the final
blind alley to the starting-point. The larva entered the timber as
slim as a tiny bit of straw; it is to-day as thick as one's finger.
In its three years' wanderings, it always dug its gallery according
to the mould of its body. Evidently, the road by which the larva
entered and moved about cannot be the Capricorn's exit-way: his
immoderate antennæ, his long legs, his inflexible armour-plates would
encounter an insuperable obstacle in the narrow, winding corridor,
which would have to be cleared of its wormed wood and, moreover,
greatly enlarged. It would be less fatiguing to attack the untouched
timber and dig straight ahead. Is the insect capable of doing so? We
shall see.</p>

<p>I make some chambers of suitable size in oak logs chopped in two; and
each of my artificial cells receives a newly-transformed Cerambyx,
such as my provisions of firewood supply, when split by the wedge, in
October. The two pieces are then joined and kept together with a few
bands of wire. June comes. I hear a scraping inside my billets. Will
the Capricorns come out, or not? The <a name="page198"></a>delivery does not seem difficult
to me: there is hardly three-quarters of an inch to pierce. Not one
emerges. When all is silence, I open my apparatus. The captives, from
first to last, are dead. A vestige of sawdust, less than a pinch of
snuff, represents all their work.</p>

<p>I expected more from those sturdy tools, their mandibles. But, as we
have seen before, the tool does not make the workman.<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small> In spite of
their boring-implements, the hermits die in my cases for lack of
skill. I subject others to less arduous tests. I enclose them in
spacious reed-stumps, equal in diameter to the natal cell. The
obstacle to be pierced is the natural diaphragm, a yielding partition
two or three millimetres<small><small><sup>6</sup></small></small> thick. Some free themselves; others
cannot. The less valiant ones succumb, stopped by the frail barrier.
What would it be if they had to pass through a thickness of oak?</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Life and Love of the Insect:</i> chap. iii. "The
tool does not make the workman. The insect exerts its gifts as a
specialist with any kind of tool wherewith it is supplied. It can saw
with a plane or plane with a saw, like the model workman of whom
Franklin tells us."&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>6</sup></small> .078 to .117 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>We are now persuaded: despite his stalwart appearance, the Capricorn
is powerless <a name="page199"></a>to leave the tree-trunk by his unaided efforts. It
therefore falls to the worm, to the wisdom of that bit of an
intestine, to prepare the way for him. We see renewed, in another
form, the feats of prowess of the Anthrax, whose pupa, armed with
trepans, bores through rock on the feeble Fly's behalf. Urged by a
presentiment that to us remains an unfathomable mystery, the
Cerambyx-grub leaves the inside of the oak, its peaceful retreat, its
unassailable stronghold, to wriggle towards the outside, where lives
the foe, the Woodpecker, who may gobble up the succulent little
sausage. At the risk of its life, it stubbornly digs and gnaws to the
very bark, of which it leaves no more intact than the thinnest film,
a slender screen. Sometimes, even, the rash one opens the window
wide.</p>

<p>This is the Capricorn's doorway. The insect will have but to file the
screen a little with its mandibles, to bump against it with its
forehead, in order to bring it down; it will even have nothing to do
when the window is free, as often happens. The unskilled carpenter,
burdened with his extravagant head-dress, will emerge from the
darkness through this opening when the summer heats arrive.</p>

<p>After the cares of the future come the <a name="page200"></a>cares of the present. The
larva, which has just opened the aperture of escape, retreats some
distance down its gallery and, in the side of the exit-way, digs
itself a transformation-chamber more sumptuously furnished and
barricaded than any that I have ever seen. It is a roomy niche,
shaped like a flattened ellipsoid, the length of which reaches some
eighty to a hundred millimetres.<small><small><sup>7</sup></small></small> The two axes of the cross-section
vary: the horizontal measures twenty-five to thirty millimetres;<small><small><sup>8</sup></small></small>
the vertical measures only fifteen.<small><small><sup>9</sup></small></small> This greater dimension of the
cell, where the thickness of the perfect insect is concerned, leaves
a certain scope for the action of its legs when the time comes for
forcing the barricade, which is more than a close-fitting mummy-case
would do.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>7</sup></small> 3 to 4 inches.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>8</sup></small> .975 to 1.17 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>9</sup></small> .585 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The barricade in question, a door which the larva builds to exclude
the dangers from without, is two- and even three-fold. Outside, it is
a stack of woody refuse, of particles of chopped timber; inside, a
mineral hatch, a concave cover, all in one piece, of a chalky white.
Pretty often, but not always, there is added to these two layers an
inner <a name="page201"></a>casing of shavings. Behind this compound door, the larva makes
its arrangements for the metamorphosis. The sides of the chamber are
rasped, thus providing a sort of down formed of ravelled woody
fibres, broken into minute shreds. The velvety matter, as and when
obtained, is applied to the wall in a continuous felt at least a
millimetre thick.<small><small><sup>10</sup></small></small> The chamber is thus padded throughout with a
fine swan's-down, a delicate precaution taken by the rough worm on
behalf of the tender pupa.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>10</sup></small> .039 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Let us hark back to the most curious part of the furnishing, the
mineral hatch or inner door of the entrance. It is an elliptical
skull-cap, white and hard as chalk, smooth within and knotted
without, resembling more or less closely an acorn-cup. The knots show
that the matter is supplied in small, pasty mouthfuls, solidifying
outside in slight projections which the animal does not remove, being
unable to get at them, and polished on the inside surface, which is
within the worm's reach. What can be the nature of that singular lid
whereof the Cerambyx furnishes me with the first specimen? It is as
hard and brittle as a flake of lime-stone. It can be dissolved cold
in nitric acid, <a name="page202"></a>discharging little gaseous bubbles. The process of
solution is a slow one, requiring several hours for a tiny fragment.
Everything is dissolved, except a few yellowish flocks, which appear
to be of an organic nature. As a matter of fact, a piece of the lid,
when subjected to heat, blackens, which proves the presence of an
organic glue cementing the mineral matter. The solution becomes muddy
if oxalate of ammonia be added and deposits a copious white
precipitate. These signs indicate calcium carbonate. I look for urate
of ammonia, that constantly-recurring product of the various stages
of the metamorphoses. It is not there: I find not the least trace of
murexide. The lid, therefore, is composed solely of carbonate of lime
and of an organic cement, no doubt of an albuminous character, which
gives consistency to the chalky paste.</p>

<p>Had circumstances served me better, I should have tried to discover
in which of the worm's organs the stony deposit dwells. I am,
however, convinced: it is the stomach, the chylific ventricle, that
supplies the chalk. It keeps it separate from the food, either as
original matter or as a derivative of the ammonium urate; it purges
it of all foreign bodies, when the larval period comes to an <a name="page203"></a>end, and
holds it in reserve until the time comes to disgorge it. This
freestone-factory causes me no astonishment: when the manufacturer
undergoes his change, it serves for various chemical works. Certain
Oil-beetles, such as the Sitaris, locate in it the urate of ammonia,
the refuse of the transformed organism; the Sphex, the Pelopæi, the
Scoliæ,<small><small><sup>11</sup></small></small> use it to manufacture the shellac wherewith the silk of
the cocoon is varnished. Further investigations will only swell the
aggregate of the products of this obliging organ.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>11</sup></small> Three species of Digger-wasps.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>When the exit-way is prepared and the cell upholstered in velvet and
closed with a three-fold barricade, the industrious worm has
concluded its task. It lays aside its tools, sheds its skin and
becomes a nymph, a pupa, weakness personified, in swaddling-clothes,
on a soft couch. The head is always turned towards the door. This is
a trifling detail in appearance; but it is everything in reality. To
lie this way or that in the long cell is a matter of great
indifference to the worm, which is very supple, turning easily in its
narrow lodging and adopting whatever position it pleases. The coming
Capricorn will not enjoy the same privileges. Stiffly girt in <a name="page204"></a>his
horn cuirass, he will not be able to turn from end to end; he will
not even be capable of bending, if some sudden wind should make the
passage difficult. He must absolutely find the door in front of him,
lest he perish in the casket. Should the grub forget this little
formality, should it lie down to its nymphal sleep with its head at
the back of the cell, the Capricorn is infallibly lost: his cradle
becomes a hopeless dungeon.</p>

<p>But there is no fear of this danger: the knowledge of the bit of an
intestine is too sound in things of the future for the grub to
neglect the formality of keeping its head to the door. At the end of
spring, the Capricorn, now in possession of his full strength, dreams
of the joys of the sun, of the festivals of light. He wants to get
out. What does he find before him? A heap of filings easily dispersed
with his claws; next, a stone lid which he need not even break into
fragments: it comes undone in one piece; it is removed from its frame
with a few pushes of the forehead, a few tugs of the claws. In fact,
I find the lid intact on the threshold of the abandoned cells. Last
comes a second mass of woody remnants as easy to disperse as the
first. The road is now free: the Cerambyx has but to follow the
spacious vestibule, <a name="page205"></a>which will lead him, without the possibility of
mistake, to the exit. Should the window not be open, all that he has
to do is to gnaw through a thin screen: an easy task; and behold him
outside, his long antennæ aquiver with excitement.</p>

<p>What have we learnt from him? Nothing from him; much from his grub.
This grub, so poor in sensory organs, gives us with its prescience no
little food for reflection. It knows that the coming Beetle will not
be able to cut himself a road through the oak and it bethinks itself
of opening one for him at its own risk and peril. It knows that the
Cerambyx, in his stiff armour, will never be able to turn and make
for the orifice of the cell; and it takes care to fall into its
nymphal sleep with its head to the door. It knows how soft the pupa's
flesh will be and upholsters the bedroom with velvet. It knows that
the enemy is likely to break in during the slow work of the
transformation and, to set a bulwark against his attacks, it stores
a calcium pap inside its stomach. It knows the future with a clear
vision, or, to be accurate, behaves as though it knew the future.
Whence did it derive the motives of its actions? Certainly not from
the experience of the senses. What does it know of the <a name="page206"></a>outside world?
Let us repeat, as much as a bit of an intestine can know. And this
sense-less creature astounds us! I regret that the clever logician,
instead of conceiving a statue smelling a rose, did not imagine it
gifted with some instinct. How quickly he would have recognized that,
quite apart from sense-impressions, the animal, including man,
possesses certain psychological resources, certain inspirations that
are innate and not acquired!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<center>THE PROBLEM OF THE SIREX</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>The cherry-tree supports a small jet-black Capricorn, <i>Cerambyx
cerdo</i>, whose larval habits it was as well to study in order to learn
whether the instincts are modified when the form and the organization
remain identical. Has this pigmy of the family the same talents as
the giant, the ravager of the oak-tree? Does it work on the same
principles? The resemblance between the two, both in the larval state
and in that of the perfect insect, is complete; the denizen of the
cherry-tree is an exact replica, on a smaller scale, of the denizen
of the oak. If instinct is the inevitable consequence of the
organism, we ought to find in the two insects a strict similarity of
habits; if instinct is, on the other hand, a special aptitude
favoured by the organs, we must expect variations in the industry
exercised. For the second time the alternative is forced upon our
attention: do the implements govern the practice of the craft, or
does the craft govern the employment of the implements? Is <a name="page208"></a>instinct
derived from the organ, or is the organ instinct's servant? An old
dead cherry-tree will answer our question.</p>

<p>Beneath its ragged bark, which I lift in wide strips, swarms a
population of larvæ all belonging to <i>Cerambyx cerdo</i>. There are big
larvæ and little larvæ; moreover, they are accompanied by nymphs.
These details tell us of three years of larval existence, a duration
of life frequent in the Longicorn series. If we hunt the thick of the
trunk, splitting it again and again, it does not show us a single
grub anywhere; the entire population is encamped between the bark and
the wood. Here we find an inextricable maze of winding galleries,
crammed with packed sawdust, crossing, recrossing, shrinking into
little alleys, expanding into wide spaces and cutting, on the one
hand, into the surface layer of the sap-wood and, on the other, into
the thin sheets of the inner bark. The position speaks for itself:
the larva of the little Capricorn has other tastes than its large
kinsman's; for three years it gnaws the outside of the trunk beneath
the thin covering of the bark, while the other seeks a deeper refuge
and gnaws the inside.</p>

<p>The dissimilarity is yet more marked in the preparations for the
nymphosis. Then <a name="page209"></a>the worm of the cherry-tree leaves the surface and
penetrates into the wood to a depth of about two inches, leaving
behind it a wide passage, which is hidden on the outside by a remnant
of bark that has been discreetly spared. This spacious vestibule is
the future insect's path of release; this screen of bark, easily
destroyed, is the curtain that masks the exit-door. In the heart of
the wood the larva finally scoops out the chamber destined for the
nymphosis. This is an egg-shaped recess an inch and a quarter to an
inch and three-quarters in length by two-fifths of an inch in
diameter. The walls are bare, that is to say, they are not lined with
the blanket of shredded fibres dear to the Capricorn of the Oak. The
entrance is blocked first by a plug of fibrous sawdust, then by a
chalky lid, similar, except in point of size, to that with which we
are already familiar. A thick layer of fine sawdust packed into the
concavity of the chalky lid, completes the barricade. Need I add that
the grub lies down and goes to sleep, for the nymphosis, with its
head against the door? Not one forgets to take this precaution.</p>

<p>The two Capricorns have, in short, the same system of closing their
cells. Note above all the lens-shaped stony lid. In each <a name="page210"></a>case we find
the same chemical composition, the same formation, like the cup of an
acorn. Dimensions apart, the two structures are identical. But no
other genus of Longicorn, so far as I am aware, practises this craft.
I will therefore complete the classic description of the
Cerambyx-beetles by adding one characteristic: they seal their
metamorphosis-chambers with a chalk slab.</p>

<p>The similarities of habit go no farther, despite the identity of
structure. There is even a very sharp contrast between the methods
pursued. The Capricorn of the Oak inhabits the deep layers of the
trunk; the Capricorn of the Cherry-tree inhabits the surface. In the
preparations for the transformation, the first ascends from the wood
to the bark, the second descends from the bark to the wood; the first
risks the perils of the outer world, the second shuns them and seeks
a retreat inside. The first hangs the walls of its chamber with
velvet, the second knows nothing of this luxury. Though the work is
almost the same in its results, it is at least carried out by
contrary methods. The tool, therefore, does not govern the trade.
This is what the two Cerambyx-beetles tell us.</p>

<p>Let us vary the testimony of the <a name="page211"></a>Longicorns. I am not selecting; I am
recording it in the order of my discoveries. The Shagreen Saperda
(<i>S. carcharias</i>) lives in the black poplar; the Scalary Saperda (<i>S.
scalaris</i>) lives in the cherry-tree. In both we find the same
organization and the same implements, as is fitting in two
closely-related species. The Saperda of the Poplar adopts the method
of the Capricorn of the Oak in its general features. It inhabits the
interior of the trunk. On the approach of the transformation, it
makes an exit-gallery, the door of which is open or else masked by a
remnant of bark. Then, retracing its steps, it blocks the passage
with a barricade of coarse packed shavings; and, at a depth of about
eight inches, not far from the heart of the tree, it hollows out a
cavity for the nymphosis without any particular upholstering. The
defensive system is limited to the long column of shavings. To
deliver itself, the insect will only have to push the heap of woody
rubbish back, in so many lots; the path will open in front of it
ready-made. If some screen of bark hide the gallery from the outside,
its mandibles will easily dispose of that: it is soft and not very
thick.</p>

<p>The Scalary Saperda imitates the habits of its messmate, the
Capricorn of the <a name="page212"></a>Cherry-tree. Its larva lives between the wood and
the bark. To undergo its transformation, it goes down instead of
coming up. In the sap-wood, parallel with the surface of the trunk,
under a layer of wood barely a twenty-fifth of an inch in thickness,
it makes a cylindrical cell, rounded at the ends and roughly padded
with ligneous fibres. A solid plug of shavings barricades the
entrance, which is not preceded by any vestibule. Here the work of
deliverance is the simplest. The Saperda has only to clear the door
of his chamber to find beneath his mandibles the little bit of bark
that remains to be pierced. As you see, we once more have to do with
two specialists, each working in his own manner with the same tools.</p>

<p>The Buprestes, as zealous as the Longicorns in the destruction of
trees, whether sound or ailing, tell us the same tale as the
Cerambyx- and Saperda-beetles. The Bronze Buprestis (<i>B. ænea</i>) is an
inmate of the black poplar. Her larva gnaws the interior of the
trunk. For the nymphosis it installs itself near the surface in a
flattened, oval cell, which is prolonged at the back by the
wandering-gallery, firmly packed with wormed wood, and in front by a
short, slightly curved vestibule. A layer of wood not a twenty-fifth
<a name="page213"></a>of an inch thick is left intact at the end of the vestibule. There is
no other defensive precaution; no barricade, no heap of shavings. In
order to come out, the insect has only to pierce an insignificant
sheet of wood and then the bark.</p>

<p>The Nine-spotted Buprestis (<i>Ptosima novemmaculata</i>) behaves in the
apricot-tree precisely as the Bronze Buprestis does in the poplar.
Its larva bores the inside of the trunk with very low-ceilinged
galleries, usually parallel with the axis; then, at a distance of an
inch and a quarter or an inch and a half from the surface, it
suddenly makes a sharp turn and proceeds in the direction of the
bark. It tunnels straight ahead, taking the shortest road, instead of
advancing by irregular windings as at first. Moreover, a sensitive
intuition of coming events inspires its chisel to alter the plan of
work. The perfect insect is a cylinder; the grub, wide in the thorax
but slender elsewhere, is a strap, a ribbon. The first, with its
unyielding cuirass, needs a cylindrical passage; the second needs a
very low tunnel, with a roof that will give a purchase to the
ambulatory nipples of the back. The larva therefore changes its
manner of boring utterly: yesterday, the gallery, suited to a
wandering life <a name="page214"></a>in the thickness of the wood, was a wide burrow with a
very low ceiling, almost a slot; to-day the passage is cylindrical: a
gimlet could not bore it more accurately. This sudden change in the
system of road-making on behalf of the coming insect once more
suggests for our meditation the eminent degree of foresight possessed
by a bit of an intestine.</p>

<p>The cylindrical exit-way passes through the strata of wood along the
shortest line, almost normally, after a slight bend which connects
the vertical with the horizontal, a curve with a radius large enough
to allow the stiff Buprestis to tack about without difficulty. It
ends in a blind-alley, less than a twelfth of an inch from the
surface of the wood. The eating away of the untouched sheet of wood
and of the bark is all the labour that the grub leaves the insect to
perform. Having made these preparations, the larva withdraws,
strengthening the wooden screen, however, with a layer of fine
sawdust; it reaches the end of the round gallery, which is prolonged
by the completely choked flat gallery; and here, scorning a special
chamber or any upholstery, it goes to sleep for the nymphosis, with
its head towards the exit.</p>
<a name="page215"></a>
<p>I find numbers of specimens of a black Buprestis (<i>B. octoguttata</i>)
in the old stumps of pine-trees left standing in the ground, hard
outside but soft within, where the wood is as pliable as tinder. In
this yielding substance, which has a resinous aroma, the larvæ spend
their life. For the metamorphosis they leave the unctuous regions of
the centre and penetrate the hard wood, where they hollow out oval
recesses, slightly flattened, measuring from twenty-five to thirty
millimetres<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> in length. The major axis of these cells is always
vertical. They are continued by a wide exit-path, sometimes straight,
sometimes slightly curved, according as the tree is to be quitted
through the section above or through the side. The exit-channel is
nearly always bored completely; the window by which the insect
escapes opens directly upon the outside world. At most, in a few rare
instances, the grub leaves the Buprestis the trouble of piercing a
leaf of wood so thin as to be translucent. But, if easy paths are
necessary to the insect, protective ramparts are no less needed for
the safety of the nymphosis; and the larva plugs the liberating
channel with a fine paste of masticated wood, very different from the
<a name="page216"></a>ordinary sawdust. A layer of the same paste divides the bottom of the
chamber from the low-ceilinged gallery, the work of the grub's active
life. Lastly, the magnifying-glass reveals upon the walls of the cell
a tapestry of woody fibres, very finely divided, standing erect and
closely shorn, so as to make a sort of velvet pile. This quilted
lining, of which the Cerambyx of the Oak showed us the first example,
is, it seems to me, pretty often employed by the wood-eaters,
Buprestes as well as Longicorns.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> .975 to 1.17 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>After these migrants, which travel from the centre of the tree to the
surface, we will mention some others which from the surface plunge
into the interior. A small Buprestis who ravages the cherry-trees,
<i>Anthaxia nitidula</i>, passes his larval existence between the wood and
the bark. When the time comes for changing its shape, the pigmy
concerns itself, like the others, with future and present needs. To
assist the perfect insect, the grub first gnaws the under side of the
bark, leaving a thin screen of cuticle untouched, and then sinks in
the wood a perpendicular well, blocked with unresisting sawdust. That
is on behalf of the future: the frail Buprestis will be able to leave
without hindrance. The bottom of the well, better wrought than the
<a name="page217"></a>rest and ceiled with the aid of an adhesive fluid which holds the
fine sawdust of the stopper in place, is a thing of the present; it
is the nymphosis-chamber.</p>

<p>A second Buprestis, <i>Chrysobothrys chrysostigma</i>, likewise an
exploiter of the cherry-tree, between the wood and the bark, although
more vigorous, expends less labour on its preparations. Its chamber,
with modestly varnished walls, is merely an expanded extension of the
ordinary gallery. The grub, disinclined for persistent labour, does
not bore the wood. It confines itself to hollowing a slanting dug-out
in the bark, without touching the surface layer, through which the
insect will have to gnaw its own way.</p>

<p>Thus each species displays special methods, tricks of the trade which
cannot be explained merely by reference to its tools. As these minute
details have consequences of some importance, I do not hesitate to
multiply them: they all help to throw light upon the subject which we
are investigating. Let us once more see what the Longicorns are able
to tell us.</p>

<p>An inhabitant of old pine-stumps, <i>Criocephalus ferus</i> makes an
exit-gallery which yawns widely on the outside world, opening either
on the section of the stump or on the <a name="page218"></a>sides. The road is barricaded
about two inches down with a long plug of coarse shavings. Next comes
the nymph's cylindrical, compressed apartment, which is padded with
woody fibres. It is continued underneath by the labyrinth of the
larva, the burrow crammed full of digested wood. Note also the
complete boring of the liberating passage, including the bark when
there is any.</p>

<p>I find <i>Stromatium strepens</i> in ilex-logs which have been stripped of
their bark. There is the same method of deliverance, the same passage
curving gently towards the nearest outside point, the same barricade
of shavings above the cell. Was the passage also carried through the
bark? The stripped logs leave me ignorant as to this detail.</p>

<p><i>Clytus tropicus</i>, a sapper of the cherry-tree, <i>C. arietis</i> and <i>C.
arvicola</i>, sappers of the hawthorn, have a cylindrical exit-gallery,
with a sharp turn to it. The gallery is masked on the outside by a
remnant of bark or wood, hardly a millimetre thick,<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> and widens,
not far from the surface, into a nymphosis-chamber, which is divided
from the burrow by a mass of packed sawdust.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> .039 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>To continue the subject would entail an <a name="page219"></a>excess of monotonous
repetition. The general law stands out very clearly from these few
data: the wood-eating grubs of the Longicorns and Buprestes prepare
the path of deliverance for the perfect insect, which will have
merely in one case to pass a barricade of shavings or wormed wood, or
in another to pierce a slight thickness of wood or bark. Thanks to a
curious reversal of its usual attributes, youth is here the season of
energy, of strong tools, of stubborn work; adult age is the season of
leisure, of industrial ignorance, of idle diversions, without trade
or profession. The infant has its paradise in the arms of its mother,
its providence; here the infant, the grub, is the providence of the
mother. With its patient tooth, which neither the perils of the
outside world nor the difficult task of boring through hard wood are
able to deter, it clears a way for her to the supreme delights of the
sun. The youngster prepares an easy life for the adult.</p>

<p>Can these armour-wearers, so sturdy in appearance, be weaklings? I
place nymphs of all the species that come to hand in glass tubes of
the same diameter as the natal cell, lined with coarse paper, which
will provide a good purchase for the boring. The obstacle to be
pierced varies: a cork a <a name="page220"></a>centimetre thick;<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> a plug of poplar, very
much softened by decay; a circular disk of sound wood. Most of my
captives easily pierce the cork and the soft wood; these represent to
them the barricade to be overthrown, the bark curtain to be
perforated. A few, however, succumb before the front to be attacked;
and all perish, after fruitless attempts, before the disk of hard
wood. Thus perished the strongest of them all, the Great Capricorn,
in my artificial oak-wood cells and even in my reed-stumps closed
with their natural partitions.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> .39 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>They have not the strength, or rather the patient art; and the larva,
more highly gifted, works for them. It gnaws with indomitable
perseverance, an essential to success even for the strong; it digs
with amazing foresight. It knows the future shape of the adult,
whether round or oval, and bores the exit-passage accordingly, making
it cylindrical in one case and elliptical in the other. It knows that
the adult is very impatient to reach the light; and it leads her
thither by the shortest way. In its wandering life in the heart of
the tree, it loves low-roofed, winding tunnels, just big enough to
pass through, or widening into stations when it strikes a <a name="page221"></a>vein with a
better flavour; now, it makes a short, straight, roomy corridor,
leading with a sharp bend to the outside world. It had plenty of time
during its capricious wanderings; the adult has none to spare: his
days are numbered; he must get out as quickly as he can. Hence the
shortest road and as little encumbered by obstacles as is consistent
with safety. The grub knows that the too sudden junction of the
horizontal and the vertical part would stop the stiff, inflexible
insect and bends it towards the outside with a gentle curve. This
elbow changing the direction occurs whenever the larva ascends from
the depths; it is very short when the nymphosis-chamber is next to
the surface, but continues for some length when the chamber is well
inside the trunk. In this case, the path traced by the grub has so
regular a curve that you feel inclined to subject the work to
geometrical measurement.</p>

<p>For want of sufficient data, I should have left this elbow in the
shadow of a note of interrogation, had I had at my disposal only the
emergence-galleries of the Longicorns and Buprestes, which are too
short to lend themselves to trustworthy examination with the
compasses. A lucky find provided me with the factors required. This
was the <a name="page222"></a>trunk of a dead poplar, riddled, to a height of several
yards, with an infinite number of round holes the diameter of a
pencil. The precious pole, still standing, is uprooted with due
respect, in view of my designs, and carried into my study, where it
is sawn into longitudinal sections planed smooth.</p>

<p>The wood, while retaining its structure, has been greatly softened by
the presence of the mycelium of a mushroom, the agaric of the poplar.
The inside is decayed. The outer layers, to a depth of over four
inches, are in good condition, save for the innumerable curved
passages that cut through them. In a section involving the whole
diameter of the trunk, the galleries of the late occupant produce a
pleasing effect, of which a sheaf of corn gives us a pretty faithful
image. Almost straight, parallel with one another and assembled in a
bundle down the middle, they diverge at the top and spread into a
cluster of wide curves, each of which ends in one of the holes on the
surface. It is a sheaf of passages which has not the single head of a
sheaf of corn, but shoots its innumerable sprouts hither and thither,
at all heights.</p>

<p>I am enraptured by this magnificent specimen. The curves, of which I
uncover a layer at every stroke of the plane, far <a name="page223"></a>exceed my
requirements; they are strikingly regular; they afford the compasses
the full space needed for accurate measurement.</p>

<p>Before calling in geometry, let us, if possible, name the creator of
these beautiful curves. The inhabitants of the poplar have
disappeared, perhaps long ago, as is proved by the mycelium of the
agaric; the insect would not gnaw and bore its way through timber all
permeated with the felt-like growth of the cryptogam. A few
weaklings, however, have died without being able to escape. I find
their remains swathed in mycelium. The agaric has preserved them from
destruction by wrapping them in tight cerements. Under these
mummy-bandages, I recognise a Saw-fly, <i>Sirex augur</i>, KLUG., in the
state of the perfect insect. And&mdash;this is an important detail&mdash;all
these adult remains, without a single exception, occupy spots which
have no means of communication with the outside. I find them
sometimes in a partly-constructed curved passage, beyond which the
wood remains intact, sometimes at the end of the straight central
gallery, choked with sawdust, which is not continued in front. These
remains, with no thoroughfare before them, tell us plainly that the
Sirex adopts for its exit methods not <a name="page224"></a>employed by the Buprestes and
the Longicorns.</p>

<p>The larva does not prepare the path of deliverance; it is left for
the perfect insect to open itself a passage through the wood. What I
have before my eyes tells me more or less plainly the sequence of
events. The larva, whose presence is proved by galleries blocked with
packed sawdust, do not leave the centre of the trunk, a quieter
retreat, less subject to the vicissitudes of the climate.
Metamorphosis is effected at the junction of the straight gallery and
the curved passage which is not yet made. When strength comes, the
perfect insect tunnels ahead for a distance of more than four inches
and opens up the exit-passage, which I find choked, not with compact
sawdust, but with loose powdery rubbish. The dead insects which I
strip of their mycelium-shrouds are weaklings whose strength deserted
them mid-way. The rest of the passage is lacking because the labourer
died on the road.</p>

<p>With this fact of the insect itself boring the exit passage, the
problem assumes a more troublesome form. If the larva, rich in
leisure and satisfied with its sojourn in the interior of the trunk,
simplifies the coming emergence by shortening the road, what must <a name="page225"></a>not
the adult do, who has so short a time to live and who is in so great
a hurry to leave the hateful darkness? He above any other should be a
judge of short cuts. To go from the murky heart of the tree to the
sun-steeped bark, why does he not follow a straight line? It is the
shortest way.</p>

<p>Yes, for the compasses, but not perhaps for the sapper. The length
traversed is not the only factor of the work accomplished, of the
total activity expended. We must take into account the resistance
overcome, a resistance which varies according to the depth of the
more or less hard strata and according to the method of attacking the
woody fibres, which are either broken across or divided lengthwise.
Under these conditions, whose value remains to be determined, can
there be a curve involving a minimum of mechanical labour in cutting
through the wood?</p>

<p>I was already trying to discover how the resistance may vary
according to depth and direction; I was working out my differentials
and my minimum integrals, when a very simple idea overturned my
slippery scaffolding. The calculation of variations has nothing to do
with the matter. The animal is not the moving body of the
mathematicians, the <a name="page226"></a>particle of matter guided in its trajectory
solely by the motive forces and the resistance of the medium
traversed; it bears within itself conditions which control the
others. The adult insect does not even enjoy the larva's privileges;
it cannot bend freely in all directions. Under its harness it is
almost a stiff cylinder. To simplify the explanation, we may liken
the insect to a section of an inflexible straight line.</p>

<p>Let us return to the Sirex, reduced by abstraction to its axis. The
metamorphosis is effected not far from the centre of the trunk. The
insect lies lengthwise in the tree with its head up, very rarely with
its head down. It must reach the outside as quickly as possible. The
section of an inflexible straight line that represents it nibbles
away a little wood in front of it and obtains a shallow cavity wide
enough to allow of a very slight turn towards the outside. An
infinitesimal advance is made; a second follows, the result of a
similar cavity and a similar turn in the same direction. In short,
each change of position is accompanied by the tiny deviation
permitted by the slight excess of width of the hole; and this
deviation invariably points the same way. Imagine a <a name="page227"></a>magnetic needle
swung out of its position and tending to return to it while moving
with a uniform speed through a resisting medium in which a sheath of
a diameter slightly greater than the needle's opens bit by bit. The
Sirex behaves more or less in the same fashion. His magnetic pole is
the light outside. He makes for that direction by imperceptible
deviations as his tooth digs.</p>

<p>The problem of the Sirex is now solved. The trajectory is composed of
equal elements, with an invariable angle between them; it is the
curve whose tangents, divided by infinitely small distances, retain
the same inclination between each one and the next; the curve, in a
word, with a constant angle of contingence. This characteristic
betrays the circumference of the circle.</p>

<p>It remains to discover whether the facts confirm the logical
argument. I take accurate tracings of a score of galleries, selecting
those whose length best lends itself to the test of the compasses.
Well, logic agrees with reality: over lengths which sometimes exceed
four inches, the track of the compasses is identical with that of the
insect. The most pronounced deviations do not exceed the small
variations which we must <a name="page228"></a>reasonably expect in a problem of a physical
nature, a problem incompatible with the absolute accuracy of abstract
truths.</p>

<p>The Sirex' exit-gallery then is a wide arc of a circle whose lower
extremity is connected with the corridor of the larva and whose upper
extremity is prolonged in a straight line which ends at the surface
with a perpendicular or slightly oblique incidence. The wide
connecting arc enables the insect to tack about. When, starting from
a position parallel with the axis of the tree, the Sirex has passed
gradually to a transversal position, he completes his course in a
straight line, which is the shortest road.</p>

<p>Does the trajectory imply the minimum of work? Yes, under the
conditions of the insect's existence. If the larva had taken the
precaution to place itself in a different direction when preparing
for the nymphosis, to turn its head towards the nearest point of the
bark instead of turning it lengthwise with the trunk, obviously the
adult would escape more easily: he would merely have to gnaw straight
in front of him in order to pass through the minimum thickness. But
reasons of convenience whereof the grub is the sole judge, reasons
dictated perhaps by weight, cause the vertical to precede the
<a name="page229"></a>horizontal position. In order to pass from the former to the latter,
the insect veers round by describing the arc of a circle. When this
turn has been effected, the distance is completed in a straight line.</p>

<p>Let us consider the Sirex at his starting-point. His stiffness of
necessity compels him to turn gradually. Here the insect can do
nothing of its own initiative; everything is mechanically determined.
But, being free to pivot on its axis and to attack the wood on either
side of the sheath, it has the option of attempting this reversal in
a host of different ways, by a series of connected arcs, not in the
same plane. Nothing prevents it from describing winding curves by
revolving upon itself: spirals, loops constantly changing their
direction, in fact, the complicated route of a creature that has lost
its way. It might wander in a tortuous maze, making fresh attempts
here, there and everywhere, groping for ever so long without
succeeding.</p>

<p>But it does not grope and it succeeds very well. Its gallery is still
contained within one plane, the first condition of the minimum of
labour. Moreover, of the different vertical planes that can pass
through the eccentric starting-point, one, the plane which passes
through the axis of the tree, <a name="page230"></a>corresponds on the one side with the
minimum of resistance to be overcome and on the other with the
maximum. Nothing prevents the Sirex from tracing his path in any one
of the multitude of planes on which the path would possess an
intermediate value between the shortest and the longest. The insect
refuses them all and constantly adopts the one which passes through
the axis, choosing, of course, the side that entails the shortest
path. In brief, the Sirex' gallery is contained in a plane pointing
towards the axis of the tree and the starting-point; and of the two
portions of this plane the channel passes through the less extensive.
Under the conditions, therefore, imposed upon him by his stiffness
the hermit of the poplar-tree releases himself with the minimum of
mechanical labour.</p>

<p>The miner guides himself by the compass in the unknown depths
underground, the sailor does the same in the unknown ocean solitudes.
How does the wood-eating insect guide itself in the thickness of a
tree-trunk? Has it a compass? One would almost say that it had, so
successfully does it keep to the quickest road. Its goal is the
light. To reach this goal, it suddenly chooses the economical plane
trajectory, after spending its larval leisure in roaming tortuous
<a name="page231"></a>passages full of irregular curves; it bends it in an arc which allows
it to turn about; and, with its head held plumb with the adjacent
surface, it goes straight ahead by the nearest way.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary obstacles are powerless to turn it aside from
its plane and its curve, so imperative is its guiding force. It will
gnaw metal, if need be, rather than turn its back upon the light,
which it feels to be close at hand. The entomological records place
this incredible fact beyond a doubt. At the time of the Crimean War,
the Institut de France received some packets of cartridges in which
the bullets had been perforated by <i>Sirex juvencus;</i> a little later,
at the Grenoble Arsenal, <i>S. gigas</i> carved himself a similar exit.
The larva was in the wood of the cartridge-boxes; and the adult
insect, faithful to its direction of escape, had bored through the
lead because the nearest daylight was behind that obstacle.</p>

<p>There is an exit-compass, that is incontestable, both for the larvæ
preparing the passage of deliverance and for the adult insect, the
Sirex obliged to make that passage for himself. What is it? Here the
problem becomes surrounded with a darkness which is perhaps
impenetrable; we are not <a name="page232"></a>well enough equipped with means of receiving
impressions even to imagine the causes which guide the creature.
There is, in certain events, another world of the senses in which our
organs perceive nothing, a world which is closed to us. The eye of
the camera sees the invisible and photographs the image of the
ultra-violet rays; the tympanum of the microphone hears what to us is
silence. A scientific toy, a chemical contrivance surpass us in
sensibility. Would it be rash to attribute similar faculties to the
delicate organization of the insect, even with regard to agencies
unknown to our science, because they do not fall within the domain of
our senses? To this question there is no positive reply; we have
suspicions and nothing more. Let us at least dispel a few false
notions that might occur to us.</p>

<p>Does the wood guide the insect, adult or larva, by its structure?
Gnawed across the grain, it must produce a certain impression; gnawed
lengthwise, it must produce a different impression. Is there not
something here to guide the sapper? No, for in the stump of a tree
left standing the emergence takes place, according to the proximity
of the light, sometimes by way of the horizontal section, by means of
a rectilinear path <a name="page233"></a>running along the grain, and sometimes by way of
the side, by means of a curved road cutting across the grain.</p>

<p>Is the compass a chemical influence, or electrical, or calorific, or
what not? No, for in an upright trunk the emergence is effected as
often by the north face, which is always in the shade, as by the
south face, which receives the sun all day long. The exit-door opens
in the side which is nearest, without any other condition. Can it be
the temperature? Not that either, for the shady side, though cooler,
is utilized as often as the side facing the sun.</p>

<p>Can it be sound? Not so. The sound of what, in the silence of
solitude? And are the noises of the outside world propagated through
half an inch of wood in such a way as to make differences
perceptible? Can it be weight? No again, for the trunk of the poplar
shows us more than one Sirex travelling upside down, with his head
towards the ground, without any change in the direction of the curved
passages.</p>

<p>What then is the guide? I have no idea. It is not the first time that
this obscure question has been put to me. When studying the emergence
of the Three-pronged Osmia from the bramble-stems shifted from their
natural <a name="page234"></a>position by my wiles, I recognized the uncertainty in which
the evidence of physical science leaves us; and, in the impossibility
of finding any other reply, I suggested a special sense, the sense of
open space. Instructed by the Sirex, the Buprestes, the Longicorns, I
am once again compelled to make the same suggestion. It is not that I
care for the expression: the unknown cannot be named in any language.
It means that the hermits in the dark know how to find the light by
the shortest road; it is the confessions of an ignorance which no
honest observer will blush to share. Now that the evolutionists'
interpretations of instinct have been recognized as worthless, we all
come to that stimulating maxim of Anaxagoras', which laconically sums
up the result of my researches:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<center>THE DUNG-BEETLES OF THE PAMPAS</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>To travel the world, by land and sea, from pole to pole; to
cross-question life, under every clime, in the infinite variety of
its manifestations: that surely would be glorious luck for him that
has eyes to see; and it formed the radiant dream of my young years,
at the time when <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> was my delight. These rosy
illusions, rich in voyages, were soon succeeded by dull, stay-at-home
reality. The jungles of India, the virgin forests of Brazil, the
towering crests of the Andes, beloved by the Condor, were reduced, as
a field for exploration, to a patch of pebbles enclosed within four
walls.</p>

<p>Heaven forfend that I should complain! The gathering of ideas does
not necessarily imply distant expeditions. Jean-Jacques Rousseau<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small>
herborized with the bunch of chick-weed whereon he fed his Canary;
Bernardin de Saint-Pierre<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> discovered a <a name="page236"></a>world on a strawberry-plant
that grew by accident in a corner of his window; Xavier de
Maistre,<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> using an arm-chair by way of post-chaise, made one of the
most famous of journeys around his room.</p>

<p>This manner of seeing country is within my means, always excepting
the post-chaise, which is too difficult to drive through the bushes.
I go the circuit of my enclosure over and over again, a hundred
times, by short stages; I stop here and I stop there; patiently, I
put questions and, at long intervals, I receive some scrap of a
reply.</p>

<p>The smallest insect village has become familiar to me: I know each
fruit-branch where the Praying Mantis<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> perches; each bush where the
pale Italian Cricket<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small> strums amid the calmness of the summer
nights; each downy plant scraped by the Anthidium, that maker of
cotton bags; each cluster of lilac worked by the Megachile, the
Leaf-cutter.</p>

<a name="page237"></a>
<p>If cruising among the nooks and corners of the garden do not suffice,
a longer voyage shows ample profit. I double the cape of the
neighbouring hedges and, at a few hundred yards, enter into relations
with the Sacred Beetle,<small><small><sup>6</sup></small></small> the Capricorn,
the Geotrupes,<small><small><sup>7</sup></small></small> the

Decticus,<small><small><sup>9</sup></small></small> the
Cricket,<small><small><sup>10</sup></small></small> the Green
Grasshopper,<small><small><sup>11</sup></small></small> in short, with a host of tribes the telling of whose
story would exhaust a lifetime. Certainly, I have enough and even too
much to do with my near neighbours, without leaving home to rove in
distant lands.</p>

<p>Besides, roaming the world, scattering one's attention over a host of
subjects, is not observing. The travelling entomologist can stick
numerous species, the joy of the collector and the nomenclator, into
his boxes; but to gather circumstantial evidence is a very different
matter. A Wandering Jew of science, he has no time to stop. Where a
prolonged stay would be necessary to study this or that <a name="page238"></a>fact, he is
hurried past the next stage. We must not expect the impossible of him
under these conditions. Let him pin his specimens to cork tablets,
let him steep them in jars of spirit, and leave to the sedentary the
patient observations that require time.</p>

<p>This explains the extreme penury of history outside the dry
descriptions of the nomenclator. Overwhelming us with its numbers,
the exotic insect nearly always preserves the secret of its manners.
Nevertheless, it were well to compare what happens under our eyes
with that which happens elsewhere; it were excellent to see how, in
the same guild of workers, the fundamental instinct varies with
climatic conditions.</p>

<p>Then my longing to travel returns, vainer to-day than ever, unless
one could find a seat on that carpet of which we read in the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, the famous carpet whereon one had but to sit to be carried
whithersoever he pleased. O marvellous conveyance, far preferable to
Xavier de Maistre's post-chaise! If I could only find just a little
corner on it, with a return-ticket!</p>

<p>I do find it. I owe this unexpected good fortune to a Brother of the
Christian Schools, to Brother Judulien, of the La Salle College at
Buenos Aires. His modesty would be <a name="page239"></a>offended by the praises which his
debtor owes him. Let us simply say that, acting on my instructions,
his eyes take the place of mine. He seeks, finds, observes, sends me
his notes and his discoveries. I observe, seek and find with him, by
correspondence.</p>

<p>It is done; thanks to this first-rate collaborator, I have my seat on
the magic carpet. Behold me in the pampas of the Argentine Republic,
eager to draw a parallel between the industry of the Sérignan<small><small><sup>12</sup></small></small>
Dung-beetles and that of their rivals in the western hemisphere.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>12</sup></small> Sérignan, in Provence, where the author ended his
days.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>A glorious beginning! An accidental find procures me, to begin with,
the Splendid Phanæus (<i>P. splendidulus</i>), who combines a coppery
effulgence with the sparkling green of the emerald. One is quite
astonished to see so rich a gem load its basket with ordure. It is
the jewel on the dung-hill. The corselet of the male is grooved with
a wide hollow and he sports a pair of sharp-edged pinions on his
shoulders; on his forehead he plants a horn which vies with that of
the Spanish Copris. While equally rich in metallic splendour, his
mate has no fantastic embellishments, which are an exclusive
prerogative <a name="page240"></a>of masculine dandyism among the Dung-beetles of La Plata
as among our own.</p>

<p>Now what can the gorgeous foreigner do? Precisely what the Lunary
Copris<small><small><sup>13</sup></small></small> does with us. Settling, like the other, under a flat cake
of Cow-dung, the South American Beetle kneads egg-shaped loaves
underground. Not a thing is forgotten: the round belly with the
largest volume and the smallest surface; the hard rind which acts as
a preservative against premature desiccation; the terminal nipple
where the egg is lodged in a hatching-chamber; and, at the end of the
nipple, the felt stopper which admits the air needed by the germ.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>13</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Sacred Beetle and Others:</i> chap.
xvi.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>All these things I have seen here and I see over there, almost at the
other end of the world. Life, ruled by inflexible logic, repeats
itself in its works, for what is true in one latitude cannot be false
in another. We go very far afield in search of a new spectacle to
meditate upon; and we have an inexhaustible specimen before our eyes,
between the walls of our enclosure.</p>

<p>Settled under the sumptuous dish dropped by the Ox, the Phanæus, one
would think, ought to make the very best use of it and <a name="page241"></a>to stock her
burrow with a number of ovoids, after the example of the Lunary
Copris. She does nothing of the sort, preferring to roam from one
find to the other and to take from each the wherewithal to model a
single pellet, which is left to itself for the soil to incubate. She
is not driven to practise economy even when she is working the
produce of the Sheep far from the pastures of the Argentine.</p>

<p>Can this be because the jewel of the pampas dispenses with the
father's collaboration? I dare not follow up the argument, for the
Spanish Copris would give me the lie, by showing me the mother
occupied alone in settling the family and nevertheless stocking her
one pit with a number of pellets. Each has her share of customs the
secret of which escapes us.</p>

<p>The two next, <i>Megathopa bicolor</i> and <i>M. intermedia</i>, have certain
points of resemblance with the Sacred Beetle, for whose ebon hue they
substitute a blue black. The first besides brightens his corselet
with magnificent copper reflections. With their long legs, their
forehead with its radiating denticulations and their flattened
wing-cases, they are fairly successful smaller editions of the famous
pill-roller.</p>
<a name="page242"></a>
<p>They also share her talent. The work of both is once again a sort of
pear, but constructed in a more ingenious fashion, with an almost
conical neck and without any elegant curves. From the point of view
of beauty, it falls short of the Sacred Beetle's work. Considering
the tools, which have ample free play and are well adapted for
clasping, I expected something better from the two modellers. No
matter: the work of the Megathopæ conforms with the fundamental art
of the other pill-rollers.</p>

<p>A fourth, <i>Bolbites onitoides</i>, compensates us for repetitions which,
it is true, widen the scope of the problem but teach us nothing new.
She is a handsome Beetle with a metallic costume, green or copper-red
according as the light happens to fall. Her four-cornered shape and
her long, toothed fore-legs make her resemble our Onites.<small><small><sup>14</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>14</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Sacred Beetle and Others:</i> chap.

<p>In her, the Dung-beetles' guild reveals itself under a very
unexpected aspect. We know insects that knead soft loaves; and here
are some which, to keep their bread fresh, discover ceramics and
become potters, working clay in which they pack the food of the
larvæ. Before my housekeeper, before <a name="page243"></a>any of us, they knew how, with
the aid of a round jar, to keep the provisions from drying during the
summer heats. The work of the Bolbites is an ovoid, hardly differing
in shape from that of the Copres; but this is where the ingenuity of
the American insect shines forth. The inner mass, the usual dung-cake
furnished by the Cow or the Sheep, is covered with a perfectly
homogeneous and continuous coating of clay, which makes a piece of
solid pottery impervious to evaporation.</p>

<p>The earthen pot is exactly filled by its contents, without the
slightest interval along the line of junction. This detail tells us
the worker's method. The jar is moulded on the provisions. After the
food-pellet has been formed in the ordinary baker's fashion and the
egg laid in its hatching-chamber, the Bolbites takes some armfuls of
the clay near at hand, applies it to the foodstuff and presses it
down. When the work is finished and smoothed to perfection with
indefatigable patience, the tiny pot, built up piecemeal, looks as
though made with the wheel and rivals our own earthenware in
regularity.</p>

<p>The hatching-chamber, in which the egg lies, is, as usual, contrived
in the nipple at the end of the pear. How will the germ and <a name="page244"></a>the young
larva manage to breathe under that clay casing, which intercepts the
access of the air?</p>

<p>Have no fears: the pot-maker knows quite well how matters stand. She
takes good care not to close the top with the plastic earth which
supplied her with the walls. At some distance from the tip of the
nipple, the clay ceases to play its part and makes way for fibrous
particles, for tiny scraps of undigested fodder, which, arranged one
above the other with a certain order, form a sort of thatched roof
over the egg. The inward and outward passage of the air is assured
through this coarse screen.</p>

<p>One is set thinking in the presence of this layer of clay, which
protects the fresh provisions, and this vent-hole stopped with a
truss of straw, which admits the air freely, while defending the
entrance. There is the eternal question, if we do not rise above the
commonplace: how did the insect acquire so wise an art?</p>

<p>Not one fails in obeying those two laws, the safety of the egg and
ready ventilation; not one, not even the next on my list, whose
talent opens up a new horizon: I am now speaking of Lacordaire's
Gromphas. Let not this repellant name of Gromphas (the old <a name="page245"></a>sow) give
us a wrong notion of the insect. On the contrary, it is, like the
last, an elegant Dung-beetle, dark-bronze, thickset, square-shaped
like our Bison Onitis<small><small><sup>15</sup></small></small> and almost as large. It also practises the
same industry, at least as regards the general effect of the work.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>15</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Sacred Beetle and Others:</i> chap.
xvi.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Its burrow branches into a small number of cylindrical cells, forming
the homes of as many larvæ. For each of these the provisions consist
of a parcel of Cow-dung, about an inch deep. The material is
carefully packed and fills the bottom of the cavity, just as a soft
paste would do when pressed down in a mould. Until now the work is
similar to that of the Bison Onitis; but the resemblance goes no
farther and is replaced by profound and curious differences, having
no connection with what the Dung-beetles of our own parts show us.</p>

<p>As we know, our sausage-makers, Onites and Geotrupes alike, place the
egg at the lower end of their cylinder, in a cell contrived in the
very midst of the mass of foodstuffs. Their rival in the pampas
adopts a diametrically opposite method: she places the egg above the
victuals, at the upper end <a name="page246"></a>of the sausage. In order to feed, the grub
does not have to work upwards; on the contrary, it works downwards.</p>

<p>More remarkable still: the egg does not lie immediately on top of the
provisions; it is installed in a clay chamber with a wall about
one-twelfth of an inch in thickness. This wall forms an
hermetically-sealed lid, curves into a cup and then rises and bends
over to make a vaulted ceiling.</p>

<p>The germ is thus enclosed in a mineral box, having no connection with
the provision-store, which is kept strictly shut. The newborn grub
must employ the first efforts of its teeth to break the seals, to cut
through the clay floor and to make a trap-door which will take it to
the underlying cake.</p>

<p>A rough beginning for the feeble mandible, even though the material
to be bored through is a fine clay. Other grubs bite at once into a
soft bread which surrounds them on every side; this one, on leaving
the egg, has to make a breach in a wall before taking nourishment.</p>

<p>Of what use are these obstacles? I do not doubt that they have their
purpose. If the grub is born at the bottom of a closed pot, if it has
to chew through brick to reach the larder, I feel sure that certain
conditions of <a name="page247"></a>its well-being demand this. But what conditions? To
become acquainted with them would call for an examination on the
spot; and all the data that I possess are a few nests, lifeless
things very difficult to interrogate. However, it is possible to
catch a glimpse of one or two points.</p>

<p>The Gromphas' burrow is shallow; those little cylinders, her loaves,
are greatly exposed to drought. Over there, as here, the drying up of
the victuals constitutes a mortal danger. To avert this peril, by far
the most sensible course is to enclose the food in absolutely shut
vessels.</p>

<p>Well, the receptacle is dug in very fine, homogeneous, water-tight
earth, with not a bit of gravel, not an atom of sand in it. Together
with the lid that forms the bottom of its round chamber, in which the
egg is lodged, this cavity becomes an urn whose contents are safe
from drought for a long time, even under a scorching sun. However
late the hatching, the new-born grub, on finding the lid, will have
under its teeth provisions as fresh as though they dated from that
very day.</p>

<p>The clay food-pit, with its closely-fitting lid, is an excellent
method, than which our agricultural experts have discovered no <a name="page248"></a>better
way of preserving fodder; but it possesses one drawback: to reach the
stack of food, the grub has first to open a passage through the floor
of its chamber. Instead of the pap called for by its weakly stomach,
it begins by finding a brick to chew.</p>

<p>The rude task would be avoided if the egg lay directly on top of the
victuals, inside the case itself. Here our logic is at fault: it
forgets an essential point, which the insect is careful not to
disregard. The germ breathes. Its development requires air; and the
perfectly-closed clay urn does not allow any air to enter. The grub
has to be born outside the pot.</p>

<p>Agreed. But, in the matter of breathing, the egg is no better off for
being shut up, on top of the provisions, in a clay casket quite as
air-tight as the jar itself. Examine the thing more closely, however,
and you will receive a satisfactory reply. The walls of the
hatching-chamber are carefully glazed inside. The mother has taken
meticulous pains to give them a stucco-like finish. The vaulted
ceiling alone is rugged, because the building-tool now works from the
outside and is unable to reach the inner surface of the lid and
smooth it. Moreover, in the centre of this curved and embossed
ceiling, a small <a name="page249"></a>opening has been made. This is the air-hole, which
allows of gaseous exchanges between the atmosphere inside the box and
that outside.</p>

<p>If it were entirely free, this opening would be dangerous: some
plunderer might take advantage of it to enter the casket. The mother
foresees the risk. She blocks the breathing-hole with a plug made of
the ravelled vegetable fibres of the Cow-dung, a stopper which is
eminently permeable. It is an exact repetition of that which the
various modellers have shown us at the top of their calabashes and
pears. All of them are acquainted with the nice secret of the felt
stopper as a means of ventilating the egg in a water-tight enclosure.</p>

<p>Your name is not an attractive one, my pretty Dung-beetle of the
pampas, but your industrial methods are most remarkable. I know some
among your fellow-countrymen, however, who surpass you in ingenuity.
One of these is <i>Phanæus Milon</i>, a magnificent insect, blue-black all
over.</p>

<p>The male's corselet juts forward. On the head is a short, broad,
flattened horn, ending in a trident. The female replaces this
ornament by simple folds. Both carry on the forehead two spikes which
form a trusty <a name="page250"></a>digging-implement and also a scalpel for dissecting.
The insect's squat, sturdy, four-cornered build resembles that of
<i>Onitis Olivieri</i>, one of the rarities of the neighbourhood of
Montpellier.</p>

<p>If similarity of shape implied purity of work, we ought
unhesitatingly to attribute to <i>Phanæus Milon</i> short, thick puddings
like those made by Olivier's Onitis.<small><small><sup>16</sup></small></small> Alas, structure is a bad
guide where instinct is concerned! The square-chined, short-legged
Dung-beetle excels in the art of manufacturing gourds. The Sacred
Beetle herself supplies none that are more correctly shaped nor,
above all, more capacious.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>16</sup></small> I owe this detail on the work of Olivier's Onitis to a
note and a sketch communicated by Professor Valéry-Mayer, of the
Montpellier School of Agriculture.&mdash;<i>Author's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The thickset insect astonishes me with the elegance of its work,
which is irreproachable in its geometry: the neck is shorter, but
nevertheless combines grace with strength. The model seems derived
from some Indian calabash, the more so as it has an open mouth and
the belly is engraved with an elegant engine-turned pattern, produced
by the insect's tarsi. One seems to see a pitcher protected by a
wickerwork covering. The <a name="page251"></a>whole attains and even exceeds the size of a
Hen's egg.</p>

<p>It is a very curious piece of work and of a rare perfection,
especially when we consider the artist's clumsy and massive build.
No, once again, the tool does not make the workman, among
Dung-beetles any more than among ourselves. To guide the modeller
there is something better than a set of tools: there is what I have
called the bump, the genius of the animal.</p>

<p><i>Phanæus Milon</i> scoffs at difficulties. He does much more than that:
he laughs at our classifications. The word Dung-beetle implies a
lover of dung. He sets no value on it, either for his own use or for
that of his offspring. What he wants is the sanies of corpses. He is
to be found under the carcasses of birds, Dogs or Cats, in the
company of the undertakers-in-ordinary. The gourd which I will
presently describe was lying in the earth under the remains of an
Owl.</p>

<p>Let him who will explain this conjunction of the appetites of the
Necrophorus<small><small><sup>17</sup></small></small> with the talents of the Sacred Beetle. As for me,
baffled by tastes which no one would suspect <a name="page252"></a>from the mere appearance
of the insect, I give it up.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>17</sup></small> Or Burying-beetle. Cf. Chapters <a href="#chap11">XI</a>. and <a href="#chap12">XII</a>. of the
present volume.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>I know in my neighbourhood one Dung-beetle and one alone who also
works among carrion. This is <i>Onthophagus ovatus</i>, LIN., a constant
frequenter of dead Moles and Rabbits. But the dwarf undertaker does
not on that account scorn stercoraceous fare: he feasts upon it like
the other Onthophagi. Perhaps there is a twofold diet here: the bun
for the adult; the highly-spiced, far-gone meat for the grub.</p>

<p>Similar facts are encountered elsewhere, with differing tastes. The
Hunting Wasp takes her fill of honey drawn from the nectaries of the
flowers, but feeds her little ones on game. Game first and then
sugar, for the same stomach! How that digestive pouch must change
during development! And yet no more than our own, which scorns in
later life the food that delighted it when young.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the work of <i>Phanæus Milon</i> more thoroughly. The
calabashes reached me in a state of complete desiccation. They are
very nearly as hard as stone; their colour inclines to a pale
chocolate. Neither inside nor out does the lens discover the
slightest ligneous particle pointing to a <a name="page253"></a>vegetable residue. The
strange Dung-beetle does not, therefore, use cakes of Cow-dung or
anything like them; he handles products of another class, which at
first are rather difficult to specify.</p>

<p>Held to the ear and shaken, the object rattles slightly, as would the
shell of a dry fruit with a stone lying free inside it. Does it
contain the grub, shrivelled by desiccation? Does it contain the dead
insect? I thought so, but I was wrong. It contains something much
more instructive than that.</p>

<p>I carefully rip up the gourd with the point of a knife. Within a
homogenous wall, whose thickness is over three-quarters of an inch in
the largest of my three specimens, is encased a spherical kernel,
which fills the cavity exactly, but without sticking to the wall at
any part. The small amount of free play allowed to this kernel
accounts for the rattling which I heard when I shook the thing.</p>

<p>In the colour and general appearance of the whole, the kernel does
not differ from the wrapper. But break it open and minutely examine
the pieces. We now recognize tiny fragments of bone, flocks of down,
threads of wool, scraps of flesh, the whole mixed in an earthy paste
resembling chocolate.</p>
<a name="page254"></a>
<p>This paste, when placed on hot charcoal, sifted under the lens and
deprived of its particles of dead bodies, becomes much darker, is
covered with shiny bubbles and sends forth puffs of that acrid smoke
by which we so readily recognize burnt animal matter. The whole mass
of the kernel, therefore, is strongly impregnated with sanies.</p>

<p>Treated in the same manner, the wrapper also turns black, but not to
the same extent; it hardly smokes; it does not become covered with
jet-black bubbles; lastly, it would not anywhere contain bits of
carcase similar to those in the central kernel. In both cases, the
residue after calcination is a fine, reddish clay.</p>

<p>This brief analysis tells us all about the table of <i>Phanæus Milon</i>.
The fare served to the grub is a sort of meat-pie. The sausage-meat
consists of a mince of all that the two scalpels of the forehead and
the toothed knives of the fore-legs have been able to remove from the
corpse: hair and down, small crushed bones, strips of flesh and skin.
Now hard as brick, the thickening of this mincemeat was originally a
paste of fine clay steeped in the liquor of corruption. Lastly, the
light crust of our meat-pies is here represented by a covering of the
same clay, <a name="page255"></a>less rich in extract of meat than the other.</p>

<p>The pastry-cook gives his work an elegant shape; he decorates it with
rosettes, with twists, with scrolls. <i>Phanæus Milon</i> is no stranger
to these culinary æsthetics. She turns the crust of her meat-pie into
a splendid gourd, with a finger-print ornamentation.</p>

<p>The outer covering, an unprofitable crust, insufficiently steeped in
savoury juices, is not, we can easily guess, intended for
consumption. It is possible that, somewhat later, when the stomach
becomes robust and is not repelled by coarse fare, the grub scrapes a
little from the sides of its pasty walls; but, until the adult insect
emerges, the calabash as a whole remains intact, having acted at
first as a safeguard of the freshness of the force-meat and all the
while as a protecting casket for the recluse.</p>

<p>Above the cold pastry, right at the base of the neck of the gourd, is
contrived a round cell with a clay wall continuing the general wall.
A fairly thick floor, made of the same material, separates it from
the store-room. This is the hatching-chamber. Here is laid the egg,
which I find in its place but dried up; here is hatched the grub,
which, to reach the ball of food, must first open a trap-door <a name="page256"></a>through
the partition that separates the two stories.</p>

<p>We have here, in short, the edifice of the Gromphas, in a different
style of architecture. The grub is born in a casket surmounting the
stack of food but not communicating with it. The budding larva must
therefore, at the opportune moment, itself pierce the covering of the
pot of preserves. As a matter of fact, later, when the grub is on the
sausage-meat, we find the floor perforated with a hole just large
enough for it to pass through.</p>

<p>Wrapped all round in a thick casing of pottery, the meat keeps fresh
as long as is required by the duration of the hatching-process, a
detail which I have not ascertained; in its cell, which is also of
clay, the egg lies safe. Capital; so far, all is well. <i>Phanæus
Milon</i> is thoroughly acquainted with the secrets of fortification and
the danger of victuals evaporating too soon. There remain the germ's
respiratory requirements.</p>

<p>To satisfy these, the insect has been equally well-inspired. The neck
of the calabash is pierced, in the direction of its axis, with a tiny
channel which would admit at most the slenderest of straws. Inside,
this conduit opens at the top of the dome of the <a name="page257"></a>hatching-chamber;
outside, at the tip of the nipple, it spreads into a wide mouth. This
is the ventilating-shaft, protected against intruders by its extreme
narrowness and by grains of dust which obstruct it a little without
stopping it up. I said it was simply marvellous. Was I wrong? If a
construction of this sort is a fortuitous result, we must admit that
blind chance is gifted with extraordinary powers of foresight.</p>

<p>How does the clumsy insect manage to accomplish so delicate and
complex a piece of building? Exploring the pampas as I do through the
eyes of an intermediary, my only guide in this question is the
structure of the work, a structure whence we can deduct the workman's
method without going far astray. I therefore imagine the building to
proceed in this manner: a small carcase is found, the oozing of which
has softened the underlying loam. The insect collects more or less of
this loam, according to the richness of the vein. There are no
precise limits here. If the plastic material be plentiful, the
collector is lavish with it and the provision-box becomes all the
more solid. Then enormous calabashes are obtained, exceeding a Hen's
egg in volume and formed of an outer wall three-quarters of an inch
thick. <a name="page258"></a>But a mass of this description is beyond the strength of the
modeller, is badly handled and betrays, in its shape, the awkwardness
attendant on an over-difficult task. If the material be rare, the
insect confines its harvesting to what is strictly necessary; and
then, freer in its movements, it obtains a magnificently regular
gourd.</p>

<p>The loam is probably first kneaded into a ball and then scooped out
into a large and very thick cup by the pressure of the fore-legs and
the work of the forehead. Even thus do the Copris and the Sacred
Beetle act when preparing, on the top of their round pill, the bowl
in which the egg will be laid before the final manipulation of the
ovoid or pear.</p>

<p>In this first business, the Phanæus is simply a potter. So long as it
be plastic, any clay serves her turn, however meagrely saturated with
the juices running from the carcase.</p>

<p>She now becomes a pork-butcher. With her toothed knife, she carves,
she saws some tiny shreds from the rotten animal; she tears off, cuts
away what she deems best suited to the grub's entertainment. She
collects all these fragments and mixes them with choice loam in the
spots where the sanies <a name="page259"></a>abounds. The whole, cunningly kneaded and
softened, becomes a ball made on the spot, without any
rolling-process, in the same way as the sphere of the other
pill-manufacturers. Let us add that this ball, a ration calculated by
the needs of the grub, is very nearly constant in size, whatever the
dimensions of the final calabash.</p>

<p>The sausage-meat is now ready. It is set in place in the wide-open
clay bowl. Loosely packed, without compression, the food will remain
free, will not stick to its wrapper.</p>

<p>Next, the potter's work is renewed. The insect presses the thick lips
of the clay cup, rolls them out and applies them to the prepared
force-meat, which is eventually contained by a thin partition at the
top end and by a thick layer every elsewhere. A wide circular pad is
left on the top partition, which is thin in view of the weakness of
the grub that is to perforate it later, when making for the
provisions. Manipulated in its turn, this pad is converted into a
hemispherical hollow, in which the egg is forthwith laid.</p>

<p>The work is completed by rolling out and joining the edges of the
little crater, which closes and becomes the hatching-chamber. <a name="page260"></a>Here,
especially, a delicate dexterity becomes essential. At the same time
that the nipple of the calabash is being shaped, the insect, when
packing the material, must leave the little channel which is to form
the ventilating-shaft, following the line of the axis. This narrow
conduit, which an ill-calculated pressure might stop up beyond hope
of remedy, seems to me extremely difficult to obtain. The most
skilful of our potters could not manage it without the aid of a
needle, which he would afterwards withdraw. The insect, a sort of
jointed automaton, makes its channel through the massive nipple of
the gourd without so much as a thought. If it did give it a thought,
it would not succeed.</p>

<p>The calabash is made: there remains the decoration. This is the work
of patient after-touches which perfect the curves and leave on the
soft loam a series of stippled impressions similar to those which the
potter of prehistoric days distributed over his big-bellied jars with
the ball of his thumb.</p>

<p>That finishes the work. The insect will begin all over again under a
fresh carcase; for each burrow has one calabash and no more, even as
with the Sacred Beetle and her pears.</p>
<a name="page261"></a>
<p>Here is another of these artists of the pampas. All black and as big
as the largest of our Onthophagi,<small><small><sup>18</sup></small></small> whom she greatly resembles in
general build, <i>Canthon bispinus</i> is likewise an exploiter of dead
bodies, if not always on her own behalf, at least on that of her
offspring.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>18</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Sacred Beetle and Others:</i> chaps. xi. xvii.,
and xviii.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>She introduces very original innovations into the pill-maker's art.
Her work, strewn like the aforementioned with finger-prints, is the
pilgrim's gourd, the double-bellied gourd. Of the two stories, which
are joined together by a fairly plainly-marked groove, the upper is
the smaller and contains the egg in an incubating-chamber; the lower
and bulkier is the food-stack.</p>

<p>Imagine the Sisyphus' little pear with its hatching-chamber swollen
into a globule a trifle smaller than the sphere at the other end;
suppose the two protuberances to be divided by a sort of wide open
groove like that of a pulley; and we shall have something very like
the Canthon's work in shape and size.</p>

<p>When placed on burning charcoal, this double-bellied gourd turns
black, becomes covered with shiny warts that look like jet <a name="page262"></a>beads,
emits a smell like that of grilled meat and leaves a residue of red
clay. It is therefore formed of clay and sanies. Moreover, the paste
is sprinkled with little scraps of dead flesh. At the smaller end is
the egg, in a chamber with a very porous roof, to allow the air to
enter.</p>

<p>The little undertaker has something better to show than her double
sausage. Like the Bison Onitis, the Sisyphus and the Lunary Copris,
she enjoys the collaboration of the father. Each burrow contains
several cradles, with the father and mother invariably present. What
are the two inseparables doing? They are watching their brood and, by
dint of assiduous repairs, keeping the little sausages, which are in
constant danger of cracking or drying up, in good condition.</p>

<p>The magic carpet which has allowed me to take this trip to the pampas
supplies me with nothing else worth noting. Besides, the New World is
poor in pill-rollers and cannot compare with Senegambia and the
regions of the Upper Nile, that paradise of Copres and Sacred
Beetles. Nevertheless we owe it one precious detail: the group which
is commonly known by the name of Dung-beetles is divided into two
<a name="page263"></a>corporations, one of which exploits dung, the other corpses.</p>

<p>With very few exceptions, the latter has no representatives in our
climes. I have mentioned the little Oval Onthophagus as a lover of
carrion corruption; and my memory does not recall any other example
of the kind. We have to go to the other world to find such tastes.</p>

<p>Can it be that there was a schism among the primitive scavengers and
that these, at first addicted to the same industry, afterwards
divided the hygienic task, some burying the ordure of the intestines,
the others the ordure of death? Can the comparative frequency of this
or the other provender have brought about the formation of two
trade-guilds?</p>

<p>That is not admissible. Life is inseparable from death; wherever a
corpse is, there also, scattered at random, are the digestive
residues of the live animal; and the pill-roller is not fastidious as
to the origin of this waste matter. Dearth therefore plays no part in
the schism, if the true dung-worker has actually turned himself into
an undertaker, or if the undertaker has turned himself into a true
dung-worker. At no time have <a name="page264"></a>materials for the work been lacking in
either case.</p>

<p>Nothing, not the scarcity of provisions, nor the climate, nor the
reversed seasons, would explain this strange divergence. We must
perforce regard it as a matter of original specialities, of tastes
not acquired but prescribed from the beginning. And what prescribed
them was anything but the structure.</p>

<p>I would defy the greatest expert to tell me, simply from the insect's
appearance and without learning the facts by experiment, the manner
of industry to which <i>Phanæus Milon</i>, for instance, devotes himself.
Remembering the Onites, who are very similar in shape and who
manipulate stercoral matter, he would look upon the foreigner as
another manipulator of dung. He would be mistaken: the analysis of
the meat-pie has told us so.</p>

<p>The shape does not make the real Dung-beetle. I have in my collection
a magnificent insect from Cayenne, known to the nomenclators as
<i>Phanæus festivus</i>, a brilliant Beetle in festive attire, charming,
beautiful, glorious to behold. How well he deserves his name! His
colouring is a metallic red, which flashes with the fire of rubies;
and he <a name="page265"></a>sets off this splendid jewellery by studding his corselet with
great spots of glowing black.</p>

<p>What trade do you follow under your torrid sun, O gleaming carbuncle?
Have you the bucolic tastes of your rival in finery, the Splendid
Phanæus? Can you be a knacker, a worker in putrid sausage-meat, like
<i>Phanæus Milon</i>? Vainly do I consider you and marvel at you: your
equipment tells me nothing. No one who has not seen you at work is
capable of naming your profession. I leave the matter to the
conscientious masters, to the experts who are able to say: I do not
know. They are scarce, in our days; but after all there are some,
less eager than others in the unscrupulous struggle which creates
upstarts.</p>

<p>This excursion to the pampas leans to one conclusion of some
importance. We find in another hemisphere, with reversed seasons, a
different climate and dissimilar biological conditions, a series of
true dung-workers whose habits and industry repeat, in their
essential facts, the habits and industry of our own. Prolonged
investigations, made at first hand and not, like mine, at second
hand, would add greatly to the list of similar workers.</p>
<a name="page266"></a>
<p>And it is not only in the grassy plains of La Plata that the
modellers of dung proceed according to the principles usual over
here; we may say, without fear of being mistaken, that the
magnificent Copres of Ethiopia and the big Sacred Beetles of
Senegambia work exactly like our own.</p>

<p>The same similarity of industry exists in other entomological series,
however distant their country. My books give details of a
Pelopæus<small><small><sup>19</sup></small></small> in Sumatra, who is an ardent Spider-huntress like our
own, who builds mud cells inside houses and who, like her, is fond of
the loose hangings of the window-curtains for the shifting foundation
of her nests. They tell me of a Scolia<small><small><sup>20</sup></small></small> in Madagascar who serves
each of her grubs with a fat rasher, an Oryctes-larva,<small><small><sup>21</sup></small></small> even as
our own Scoliæ feed their family on prey of similar organization,
with a highly concentrated nervous system, such as the larvæ of
Cetoniæ, Anoxiæ and even Oryctes. They <a name="page267"></a>tell me that in Texas a
Pepsis, a huntress of big game akin to the Calicurgi, gives chase to
a formidable Tarantula and vies in daring with our Ringed
Calicurgus,<small><small><sup>22</sup></small></small> who stabs the
Black-bellied Lycosa.<small><small><sup>23</sup></small></small> They tell me
that the Sphex-wasps of the Sahara, a rival of our own White-banded
Sphex,<small><small><sup>24</sup></small></small> operate on Locusts. But we must limit these quotations,
which could easily be multiplied.</p>

<p>For producing variations of animal species to suit our theorists
there is nothing so convenient as the influence of environment. It is
a vague, elastic phrase, which does not compromise us by compelling
us to be too precise and it supplies an apparent explanation of the
inexplicable. But is this influence so powerful as they say?</p>

<p>I grant you that to some small extent it modifies the shape, the fur
or feather, the colouring, the outward accessories. To go farther
would be to fly in the face of facts. If the surroundings become too
exacting, the animal protests against the violence endured and
succumbs rather than change. If they <a name="page268"></a>go to work gently, the creature
subjected to them adapts itself as best it can, but invincibly
refuses to cease to be what it is. It must live in the form of the
mould whence it issued, or it must die: there is no other
alternative.</p>

<p>Instinct, one of the higher characteristics, is no less rebellious to
the injunctions of environment than are the organs, which serve its
activity. Innumerable guilds divide the work of the entomological
world; and each member of one of these corporations is subject to
rules which not climate, nor latitude, nor the most serious
disturbances of diet are able to alter.</p>

<p>Look at the Dung-beetles of the pampas. At the other end of the
world, in their vast flooded pastures, so different from our scanty
greenswards, they follow, without notable variations, the same
methods as their colleagues in Provence. A profound change of
surroundings in no way effects the fundamental industry of the group.</p>

<p>Nor do the provisions available affect it. The staple food to-day is
matter of bovine origin. But the Ox is a newcomer in the land, an
importation of the Spanish conquest. What did the Megathopæ, the
Bolbites, the Splendid Phanæus eat and knead, before the <a name="page269"></a>arrival of
the present purveyor? The Llama, that denizen of the uplands, was not
able to feed the Dung-beetles confined to the plains. In days of old,
the foster-father was perhaps the monstrous Megatherium, a
dung-factory of incomparable prodigality.</p>

<p>And from the produce of the colossal beast, whereof naught remains
but a few rare skeletons, the modellers passed to the produce of the
Sheep and the Ox, without altering their ovoids or their gourds, even
as our Sacred Beetle, without ceasing to be faithful to her pear,
accepts the Cow's flat cake in the absence of the favourite morsel,
the Sheep's bannock.</p>

<p>In the south as in the north, at the antipodes as here, every Copris
fashions ovoids with the egg at the smaller end; every Sacred Beetle
models pears or gourds with a hatching-chamber in the neck; but the
materials employed vary greatly according to the season and locality
and can be furnished by the Megatherium, the Ox, the Horse, the Sheep
or by man and several others.</p>

<p>We must not allow this diversity to lead us to believe in changes of
instinct: that would be to strain at a Gnat and swallow a Camel. The
industry of the Megachiles, for instance, consists of manufacturing
<a name="page270"></a>wallets with bits of leaves; that of the Cotton-bees of making bags
of wadding with the flock gathered from certain plants. Whether the
pieces be cut from the leaves of this shrub or that, or at need from
the petals of some flower; whether the cotton-wool be collected here
or there, as chance may direct the encounter, the industry undergoes
no essential changes.</p>

<p>In the same manner, nothing changes in the art of the Dung-beetle,
victualling himself with materials in this mine or that. Here in
truth we have immutable instinct, here we behold the rock which our
theorists are unable to shake.</p>

<p>And why should it change, this instinct, so logical in its workings?
Where could it find, even with chance assisting, a better plan? In
spite of an equipment which varies in the different genera, it
suggests to every modelling Dung-beetle the spherical shape, a
fundamental structure which is hardly affected when the egg is placed
in position.</p>

<p>From the outset, without the use of compasses, without any mechanical
rolling, without shifting the thing on its base, one and all obtain
the ball, the delicately executed compact body supremely favourable
to the grub's well-being. To the shapeless lump, <a name="page271"></a>demanding no pains,
they all prefer the sphere, lovingly fashioned and calling for much
manipulation, the globe which is the preeminent form and best-adapted
for the preservation of energy, in the case of a sun and of a
Dung-beetle's cradle alike.</p>

<p>When Macleay<small><small><sup>25</sup></small></small> gave the Sacred Beetle the name of Heliocantharus,
the Black-beetle of the Sun, what had he in mind? The radiating
denticulations of the forehead, the insect's gambols in the bright
sunlight? Was he not thinking rather of the symbol of Egypt, the
Scarab who, on the pediment of the temples, lifts towards the sky, by
way of a pill, a vermilion sphere, the image of the sun?</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>25</sup></small> William Sharp Macleay (1792-1865), author of <i>Horæ
Entomologicæ;</i> or, <i>Essays on Annulose Animals</i> (1819-1821), on which

<blockquote><small>"He propounded the circular or quinary system, a forcedly artificial
attempt at a natural system of classification, which soon became a
byword among naturalists."&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The comparison between the mighty bodies of the universe and the
insect's humble pellet was not distasteful to the thinkers on the
banks of the Nile. For them supreme splendour found its effigy in
extreme abjection. Were they very wrong?</p>

<p>No, for the pill-roller's work propounds <a name="page272"></a>a grave problem to whoso is
capable of reflection. It compels us to accept this alternative:
either to credit the Dung-beetle's flat head with the signal honour
of having of itself solved the geometrical problem of preserved food,
or else to fall back upon a harmony ruling all things under the eye
of an Intelligence Which, knowing everything, has provided for
everything.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<center>INSECT COLOURING</center>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>Phanæus splendidulus</i>, the glittering, the resplendent: this is the
epithet selected by the official nomenclators to describe the
handsomest Dung-beetle of the pampas. The name is not at all
exaggerated. Combining the fire of gems with metallic lustre, the
insect, according to the incidence of the light, emits the green
reflections of the emerald or the gleam of ruddy copper. The
muck-raker would do honour to the jeweller's show-cases.</p>

<p>For the rest, our own Dung-beetles, though usually modest in their
attire, also have a leaning toward luxurious ornament. One
Onthophagus decorates his corselet with Florentine bronze; another
wears garnets on his wing-cases. Black above, the Mimic Geotrupes is
the colour of copper pyrites below; also black in all parts exposed
to the light of day, the Stercoraceous Geotrupes displays a ventral
surface of a glorious amethyst violet.</p>

<p>Many other series, of greatly varied <a name="page274"></a>habits, Carabi,<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> Cetoniæ,
Buprestes, Chrysomelæ,<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> rival and even surpass the magnificent
Dung-beetles in the matter of jewellery. At times we encounter
splendours which the imagination of a lapidary would not venture to
depict. The Azure Hoplia,<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> the inmate of the osier-beds and elders
by the banks of the mountain streams, is a wonderful blue, tenderer
and softer to the eye than the azure of the heavens. You could not
find an ornament to match it save on the throats of certain
Humming-birds and the wings of a few Butterflies in equatorial
climes.</p>

<p>To adorn itself like this, in what Golconda does the insect gather
its gems? In what diggings does it find its gold nuggets? What a
pretty problem is that of a Buprestis' wing-case! Here the chemistry
of colours ought to reap a delightful harvest; but the difficulties
are great, it seems, so much so that science cannot yet tell us the
why and the wherefore of the humblest costume. The answer will come
in a remote future, if indeed it ever comes completely, for life's
laboratory may well contain secrets denied <a name="page275"></a>to our retorts. For the
moment, I shall perhaps be contributing a grain of sand to the future
palace if I describe the little that I have seen.</p>

<p>My basic observation dates a long way back. I was at that time busy
with the Hunting Wasps, following their larval development from the
egg to the cocoon. Let us take an instance from my notes, which cover
nearly all the game-hunters of my district. I will choose the larva
of the Yellow-winged Sphex,<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> which, with its convenient size, will
furnish an easy object-lesson.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Hunting Wasps:</i> chap. iv.&mdash;<i>Translator's
Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Under the transparent skin of the larva, which has been recently
hatched and is consuming its first Cricket, we soon perceive some
fine white spots, which rapidly increase in size and number and
eventually cover the whole body, except the first two or three
segments. On dissecting the grub, we find that these spots have to do
with the adipose layer, of which they form a considerable part, for,
far from being scattered only on the surface, they run through its
whole thickness and are present in such numbers that the forceps
cannot seize the least fragment of this tissue without picking up a
few of them.</p>
<a name="page276"></a>
<p>Though perfectly visible without the help of a lens, these puzzling
spots call for the microscope if we wish to study them in detail. We
then find that the adipose tissue is made up of two kinds of
vesicles: some, bright yellow and transparent, are filled with oily
drops; the rest, opaque and starch-white, are distended with a very
fine powder, which spreads in a cloudy trail when the vesicle
containing it is broken on the object-slide. Intermingled without
apparent order, the two kinds of bags are of the same shape and the
same size. The first go to make up the nutritive reserves, the fatty
tissue properly so-called; the second form the white dots which we
will study for a moment.</p>

<p>An inspection under the microscope tells us that the contents of the
white cells are composed of very fine, opaque grains, insoluble in
water and of greater density. The use of chemical reagents on the
object-slide proves that nitric acid dissolves these grains, with
effervescence and without leaving the least residue, even when they
are still enclosed in their vesicles. On the other hand, the true
fatty cells suffer in no way when attacked by this acid; they merely
turn a little yellower.</p>

<p>Let us take advantage of this property to <a name="page277"></a>operate on a larger scale.
The adipose tissue taken from a number of larvæ is treated with
nitric acid. The effervescence is as lively as if the reaction were
taking effect on a bit of chalk. When it has subsided, some yellow
clots are floating on the surface. These are easily separated. They
come from the fatty substance and the cellular membranes. There
remains a clear liquid containing the white granules in solution.</p>

<p>The riddle of these granules was being presented to me for the first
time; my predecessors had provided no physiological or anatomical
data to guide me; great therefore was my joy when, after a little
fumbling, I succeeded in hitting upon their characteristic feature.</p>

<p>The solution is evaporated in a small porcelain capsule, placed on
the hot embers. On the residue I pour a few drops of ammonia, or else
simply water. A glorious crimson colour at once makes its appearance.
The problem is solved: the colouring-matter which has just formed is
murexide; and consequently the powdery substance which filled the
cells was none other than uric acid, or more precisely ammonium
urate.</p>

<p>A physiological fact of this importance can hardly stand alone.
Indeed, since this basic <a name="page278"></a>experiment I have discovered grains of uric
acid in the adipose tissue of the larvæ of all the Hunting Wasps of
our parts, as well as in the Bees at the moment of the nymphosis. I
have observed them in many other insects, either in the larval or in
the perfect state; but in this respect there is none to equal the
grub of the game-hunting Wasp, which is all speckled with white. I
think I see the reason.</p>

<p>Let us consider two larvæ which eat live prey: that of the Sphex and
that of the Hydrophilus.<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small> Uric acid, the inevitable product of the
vital transformations, or at all events one of its analogues, must be
formed in both. But the Hydrophilus' larva shows no accumulation of
it in its adipose layer, whereas the Sphex' is full of it.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> The Great Water-beetle.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>In the latter the duct through which the solid excretions pass is not
yet in working order; the digestive apparatus, tied at the lower end,
is not discharging an atom. The urinary products, being unable, for
want of an open outlet, to flow away as formed, accumulate in the
adipose tissue, which thus serves as a common store-house for the
residues of the present and the plastic material of the future
organic processes. <a name="page279"></a>Here something occurs analogous to what we see in
the higher animals after the removal of the kidneys; the urea at
first contained in the blood, in imperceptible quantities accumulates
and becomes manifest when the means by which it is eliminated
disappear.</p>

<p>In the larva of the Hydrophilus, on the other hand, the excretions
enjoy a free outlet from the beginning; and the urinary products
escape as and when formed and are no longer deposited in the adipose
tissue. But during the intense labour of the metamorphosis, any
excretion becomes impossible; the uric acid must and does collect in
the adipose substance of the different larvæ.</p>

<p>It would be out of place, despite its importance, to pursue the
problem of the uric residues any further. Our subject is coloration.
Let us return to it with the evidence supplied by the Sphex. Her
almost transparent larva has the neutral tint of fluid white of egg.
Under its fine translucid skin there is nothing coloured, save the
long digestive pouch, which is swollen a deep purple by the pulp of
the consumed Crickets. But against this indefinite, vitreous
background the opaque white uric cells stand out distinctly in their
myriads; and the effect of this stippling is a sketchy but by no
means inelegant <a name="page280"></a>costume. It is skimpy in the extreme, but at any rate
it is something.</p>

<p>With the urinary broth of which its intestine is unable to get rid,
the larva has discovered a means of making itself look a little
smart. The Anthidia have shown us how, in their cotton-wool wallets,
they manufacture a sort of jewellery with their ordure. The robe
studded with grains of alabaster is a no less ingenious invention.</p>

<p>To beautify themselves cheaply by using up their own refuse is a very
common method even among insects endowed with all that is wanted for
evacuating waste matter. While the larvæ of the Hunting Wasps, unable
to do better, stipple themselves with uric acid, there are plenty of
industrious creatures that are able to make themselves a superb dress
by preserving their excretions in spite of their own open sewers.
With a view to self-embellishment, they collect and treasure up the
dross which others hasten to expel. They turn filth into finery.</p>

<p>One of these is the White-faced Decticus (<i>D. albifrons</i>, F<small>AB</small>.), the
biggest sabre-bearer of the Provençal fauna. A magnificent insect is
this Grasshopper, with a broad ivory face, a full, creamy-white belly
and long wings flecked with brown. In July, the <a name="page281"></a>season for the
wedding-dress, let us dissect him under water.</p>

<p>The adipose tissue, which is abundant and yellowish white, consists
of a lace of wide, irregular, criss-cross meshes. It is a tubular
network swollen with a powdery matter which condenses into minute
chalk-white spots, standing out very plainly against a transparent
background. When crushed in a drop of water, a fragment of this
fabric yields a milky cloud in which the microscope shows an infinite
number of opaque floating atoms, without revealing the smallest blob
of oil, the sign of fatty matter.</p>

<p>Here again we have ammonium urate. Treated with nitric acid, the
adipose tissue of the Decticus produces an effervescence similar to
that of chalk and yields enough murexide to redden a tumblerful of
water. A strange adipose body, this bundle of lace crammed with uric
acid without a trace of fatty matter! What would the Decticus do with
nutritive reserves, seeing that he is near his end, now that the
nuptial season has arrived? Delivered from the necessity of saving
for the future, he has only to spend in gaiety the few days left to
him; he has only to adorn himself for the supreme festival.</p>

<p>He therefore converts into a paint-factory <a name="page282"></a>what at first was a
warehouse for storing up foodstuffs; and with his chalk-like uric
pulp he lavishly daubs his belly, which turns a creamy white, and
smears it on his forehead, his face, his cheeks, until they assume
the appearance of old ivory. All those parts, in fact, which lie
immediately under the translucid skin are covered with a layer of
pigment which can be turned into murexide and is identical in nature
with the white powder of the adipose lace.</p>

<p>Biological chemistry can hardly offer a simpler and more striking
experiment than this analysis of the Decticus' finery. To those who
have not this curious Grasshopper handy, I recommend the Ephippiger
of the Vines, who is much more widely distributed. His ventral
surface, which also is of a creamy white, likewise owes its colour to
a plastering of uric acid. In the Grasshopper family many other
species of smaller size and requiring more delicate handling would
give us the same results in varying degrees.</p>

<p>White, slightly tinged with yellow, is all that the urinary palette
of the Locustidæ shows us. A caterpillar, the Spurge Hawk-moth's,
will take us a little farther. Dappled red, black, white and yellow,
its livery is the most remarkable in our part of the country. <a name="page283"></a>Réaumur
in fact calls it <i>la Belle</i>. The flattering title is well-deserved.
On the black background of the larva, vermillion-red, chrome-yellow
and chalk-white figure side by side in circles, spots, freckles and
stripes, as clearly marked as the glaring patches of a harlequin's
dress.</p>

<p>Let us dissect the caterpillar and apply the lens to its mosaic. On
the inner surface of the skin, except in the portions coloured black,
we observe a pigmentary layer, a coating here red, there yellow or
white. We will cut a strip from this coat of many colours, after
depriving it of its muscular fibres, and subject it to the action of
nitric acid. The pigment, no matter what its hue, dissolves with
effervescence and afterwards yields murexide. Here again, then, it is
to uric acid, present, however, in small quantities in the adipose
tissue, that the caterpillar's rich livery is due.</p>

<p>The black parts are an exception. Unassailable by nitric acid, they
retain their sombre tint after treatment as before, whereas the
portions stripped of their pigment by the reagent become almost as
transparent as glass. The skin of the handsome caterpillar thus has
two sorts of coloured patches.</p>
<a name="page284"></a>
<p>Those of an intense black may be likened to dyers' products: they are
completely impregnated with the colouring matter, which is part and
parcel of the molecular constitution and cannot be isolated by the
nitric solvent. The others, red, yellow or white, are actually
painted: on a translucid sheet is a wash of urinary pigment, which is
discharged by the minute ducts issuing from the adipose layer. When
the action of the nitric acid has ceased, the transparent circles of
the latter stand out against the black background of the former.</p>

<p>Yet one more example taken from a different order. As regards
elegance of costume, the Banded Epeira<small><small><sup>6</sup></small></small> is the most highly favoured
of our Spiders. On the upper surface of her corpulent belly
alternate, in transversal bands, bright black, a vivid yellow like
that of yolk of egg and a dazzling white like that of snow. The black
and yellow also show underneath, but arranged differently. The
yellow, in particular, forms two longitudinal ribbons, ending in
orange-red on either side of the spinnerets. A pale purple is faintly
diffused over the sides.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>6</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Life of the Spider:</i> chaps. ii., vii., xi. and
xiii.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Examined from the outside with the lens, <a name="page285"></a>the black parts reveal
nothing out of the common. The black is homogeneous and everywhere of
equal depth. On the other hand, in the coloured portions, we see
little polygonal, granular masses, forming a close-meshed network. By
cutting round the circumference of the abdomen with a pair of
scissors, the horny integument of the dorsal surface may readily be
removed in one piece, without any shreds of the organs which it
protected. This large strip of skin is transparent in the zones that
correspond with the white bands in the natural state; it is black or
yellow on the black or yellow bands. These last indeed owe their
colouring to a layer of pigment which the point of a paintbrush will
easily loosen and remove.</p>

<p>As for the white bands, their origin is this: once the skin has been
removed, the dorsal surface of the abdomen, whose graceful mosaic is
not in any way disturbed, reveals a layer of polygonal white spots,
distributed in belts, here densely and there less so. The denser
belts correspond with the white bands. It is their magnificent opaque
white granulations which, seen through the transparent skin, form the
snow-white stripes in the live Spider.</p>

<p>Treated with nitric acid on the microscopic <a name="page286"></a>slide, they do not
dissolve nor produce effervescence. Uric acid then is not present in
this case; and the substance must be guanine, an alkaloid known to be
the urinary product of the Spiders. The same is true of the yellow,
black, purple or orange pigment that forms a coating under the skin.
In short, by utilizing, in a different chemical combination, the
waste products of animal oxidization, the magnificent Spider rivals
the magnificent caterpillar; she beautifies herself with guanine as
the other does with its uric acid.</p>

<p>Let us abridge this dry subject; let us be content with these few
data, which could if necessary be corroborated by many others. What
does the little that we have learnt teach us? It tells us that the
materials rejected by the organism, guanine, uric acid and other
dross from life's refinery, play an important part in the coloration
of the insect.</p>

<p>Two cases are distinguishable, according as the colour is dyed or
simply painted. The skin, itself colourless and transparent, is in
places illumined by a coloured varnish, which can be removed by a
touch with a paintbrush. Here we have paint, the result of the
urinary compound laid on the inner surface of the covering, just as
the chromatic <a name="page287"></a>ingredients of our glass-painters are laid on our
stained-glass windows.</p>

<p>At other places the skin is coloured in its very substance; the
colouring-matter forms an integral part of it and can no longer be
swept away with a camel-hair brush. Here we have a dyed fabric,
represented in our windows by the panes of coloured glass which the
crucible decorates uniformly with this or that tint, by means of the
incorporated metallic oxides.</p>

<p>Whereas, in these two cases, there is a profound difference in the
distribution of the chromatic materials, is this true of their
chemical nature as well? The suggestion is hardly admissible. The
worker in stained glass dyes or paints with the same oxides. Life,
that incomparable artist, must even more readily obtain an infinite
variety of results by uniformity of method.</p>

<p>It shows us, on the back of the Spurge Caterpillar,<small><small><sup>7</sup></small></small> black spots
jumbled up with other spots, white, yellow or red. Paints and dyes
lie side by side. Is there on this side of the dividing line a
paint-stuff and on the other side a dye-stuff, absolutely different
in character from the first? While <a name="page288"></a>chemistry is not yet in a position
to demonstrate, with its reagents, the common origin of the two
substances, at least the most convincing analogies point to it.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>7</sup></small> The caterpillar of the Spurge Hawk-moth.&mdash;<i>Translator's
Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>In this delicate problem of the insect's colouring, one single point
thus far comes within the domain of observed facts: the progressive
advance of chromatic evolution. The carbuncle of the Dung-Beetle of
the Pampas suggested the question. Let us then inquire of his near
neighbours, who will perhaps enable us to advance a step farther.</p>

<p>Newly stripped of his cast-off nymphal skin, the Sacred Beetle
possesses a strange costume, bearing no resemblance to the ebony
black which will be the portion of the mature insect. The head, legs
and thorax are a bright rusty red; the wing-cases and abdomen are
white. As a colour, the red is almost that of the Spurge Caterpillar,
but it is the result of a dye on which nitric acid has no effect as a
detector of urates. The same chromatic principle must certainly exist
in a more elaborate form and under a different molecular arrangement
in the skin of the abdomen and the wing-cases which will presently
replace white by red.</p>

<p>In two or three days the colourless becomes the coloured, a process
whose rapidity <a name="page289"></a>implies a fresh molecular structure rather than a
change of composition. The building-stone remains the same, but is
arranged in a different order; and the structure alters in
appearance.</p>

<p>The Scarabæus is now all red. The first brown stains show themselves
on the denticulations of the forehead and fore-legs, the sign of an
earlier maturity in the implements of labour, which are to acquire an
exceptional hardness. The smoky tinge spreads more or less all over
the insect, replaces the red, turns darker and finally becomes the
regulation black. In less than a week the colourless insect turns a
rusty red, next a sooty brown and then an ebony black. The process is
completed; the insect possesses its normal colouring.</p>

<p>Even so do the Copres, the Gymnopleuri,<small><small><sup>8</sup></small></small> the Onites, the Onthophagi
and many others behave; even so must the jewel of the pampas, the
Splendid Phanæus set to work. With as much certainty as though I had
him before my eyes at the moment when he divests himself of his
nymphal swaddling-bands, I see him a dull red, rusty or crimson,
excepting on the wing-covers and the <a name="page290"></a>abdomen, which are at first
colourless and presently turn the same colour as the rest. In the
Sacred Beetle this initial red is followed by black; the Phanæus
replaces it by the brilliance of copper and the reflections of the
emerald. Ebony, metal, the gem: have they the same origin here then?
Evidently.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>8</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Sacred Beetle and Others:</i> chap.
viii.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The metallic lustre does not call for a change of nature; a mere
nothing is enough to produce it. Silver, when very finely subdivided
by the methods whereof chemistry knows the secret, becomes a dust as
poor to look at as soot. When pressed between two hard bodies, this
dirty powder, which might be dried mud, at once acquires the metallic
sheen and again becomes the silver which we know. A mere molecular
contact has wrought the miracle.</p>

<p>Dissolved in water, the murexide derived from uric acid is a
magnificent crimson. Solidified by crystallization, it rivals in
splendour the gold-green of the Cantharides. The widely-used fuschine
affords a well-known example of like properties.</p>

<p>Everything, then, appears to show that the same substance, derived
from urinary excretions, yields, according to the mode in which its
ultimate particles are grouped, the metallic red of the Phanæus, as
well as the <a name="page291"></a>white, the dull red and the black of the Sacred Beetle.
It becomes black on the dorsal surface of the Stercoraceous Geotrupes
and the Mimic Geotrupes; and, with a quick change, it turns into
amethyst under the belly of the first and into copper pyrites under
the belly of the second. It covers the back of <i>Cetonia floricola</i>
with golden bronze and the under surface with metallic purple.
According to the insect, according to the part of the body, it
remains a dingy compound or sparkles with reflections even more vivid
and varied than those possessed by the metals.</p>

<p>Light seems irrelevant to the development of these splendours; it
neither accelerates nor retards them. Since direct exposure to the
sun, owing to the excess of heat, is fatal to the delicate process of
the nymphosis, I shaded the solar rays with a screen of water
contained between slips of glass; and to the bright light thus
moderated in temperature I daily, throughout the period of chromatic
evolution, subjected a number of Sacred Beetles, Geotrupes and
Cetoniæ. As standards of comparison I had witnesses of whom I kept
some in diffused light and others in complete darkness. My
experiments had no appreciable result. The development of the colours
took place in the sunlight and in the <a name="page292"></a>dark alike, neither more
rapidly nor more slowly and without difference in the tints.</p>

<p>This negative result was easy to foresee. The Buprestis emerging from
the depths of the trunk in which he has spent his larval life; the
Geotrupes and the Phanæus leaving their natal burrows possess their
final adornments, which will not become richer in the rays of the
sun, at the time when they make their appearance in the open air. The
insect does not claim the assistance of the light for its colour
chemistry, not even the Cicada,<small><small><sup>9</sup></small></small> who bursts her larval scabbard and
changes from pale green to brown as easily in the darkness of my
apparatus as in the sunlight, in the usual manner.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>9</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Life of the Grasshopper:</i> chaps. i. to
v.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The chromatics of the insect, having as its basis the urinary waste
products, might well be found in various animals of a higher order.
We know of at least one example. The pigment of a small American
lizard is converted into uric acid under the prolonged action of
boiling hydrochloric acid.<small><small><sup>10</sup></small></small> This cannot be an isolated instance;
and there is reason to believe that the reptilian class <a name="page293"></a>daubs its
garments with similar products.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>10</sup></small> A. B. Griffiths, Transactions of the Académie des
sciences, 26 November, 1894.&mdash;<i>Author's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>From the reptile to the bird is no great distance. Then the
Wood-pigeon's iridescent hues, the eyes on the Peacock's tail, the
Kingfisher's sea-blue, the Flamingo's carmine are more or less
closely connected with the urinary excretions? Why not? Nature, that
sublime economist, delights in these vast antitheses which upset all
our conceptions of the values of things. Of a pinch of common
charcoal she makes a diamond; of the same clay which the potter
fashions into a bowl for the Cat's supper she makes a ruby; of the
filthy waste products of the organism she makes the splendours of the
insect and the bird. The metallic marvels of the Buprestis and the
Ground-beetle; the amethyst, ruby, sapphire, emerald and topaz of the
Humming-bird; glories which would exhaust the language of the
lapidary jeweller: what are they in reality? Answer: a drop of urine.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<center>THE BURYING-BEETLES: THE BURIAL</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>Beside the footpath in April lies the Mole, disembowelled by the
peasant's spade; at the foot of the hedge the pitiless urchin has
stoned to death the Lizard, who was about to don his green,
pearl-embellished costume. The passer-by has thought it a meritorious
deed to crush beneath his heel the chance-met Adder; and a gust of
wind has thrown a tiny unfledged bird from its nest. What will become
of these little bodies and so many other pitiful remnants of life?
They will not long offend our sense of sight and smell. The sanitary
officers of the fields are legion.</p>

<p>An eager freebooter, ready for any task, the Ant is the first to come
hastening and begin, particle by particle, to dissect the corpse.
Soon the odour attracts the Fly, the genitrix of the odious maggot.
At the same time, the flattened Silpha,<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> the glistening,
slow-trotting Cellar-beetle, the Dermestes,<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> powdered with <a name="page295"></a>snow
upon the abdomen, and the slender Staphylinus,<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> all, whence coming
no one knows, hurry hither in squads, with never-wearied zeal,
investigating, probing and draining the infection.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Or Carrion-beetle.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> Or Rove-beetle.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>What a spectacle, in the spring, beneath a dead Mole! The horror of
this laboratory is a beautiful sight for one who is able to observe
and to meditate. Let us overcome our disgust; let us turn over the
unclean refuse with our foot. What a swarming there is beneath it,
what a tumult of busy workers! The Silphæ, with wing-cases wide and
dark, as though in mourning, flee distraught, hiding in the cracks in
the soil; the Saprini,<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> of polished ebony which mirrors the
sunlight, jog hastily off, deserting their workshop; the Dermestes,
of whom one wears a fawn-coloured tippet flecked with white, seek to
fly away, but, tipsy with the putrid nectar, tumble over and reveal
the immaculate whiteness of their bellies, which forms a violent
contrast with the gloom of the rest of their attire.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> The Saprinus is a very small carnivorous Beetle. Cf.
<i>The Life of the Fly:</i> chap. xvi.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>What were they doing there, all these feverish workers? They were
making a <a name="page296"></a>clearance of death on behalf of life. Transcendent
alchemists, they were transforming that horrible putrescence into a
living and inoffensive product. They were draining the dangerous
corpse to the point of rendering it as dry and sonorous as the
remains of an old slipper hardened on the refuse-heap by the frosts
of winter and the heats of summer. They were working their hardest to
render the carrion innocuous.</p>

<p>Others will soon put in their appearance, smaller creatures and more
patient, who will take over the relic and exploit it ligament by
ligament, bone by bone, hair by hair, until the whole has been
restored to the treasury of life. All honour to these purifiers! Let
us put back the Mole and go our way.</p>

<p>Some other victim of the agricultural labours of spring, a
Shrew-mouse, Field-mouse, Mole, Frog, Adder, or Lizard, will provide
us with the most vigorous and famous of these expurgators of the
soil. This is the Burying-beetle, the Necrophorus, so different from
the cadaveric mob in dress and habits. In honour of his exalted
functions he exhales an odour of musk; he bears a red tuft at the tip
of his antennæ; his breast is covered with nankeen; and across his
wing-cases he wears a double, scalloped scarf of vermillion. <a name="page297"></a>An
elegant, almost sumptuous costume, very superior to that of the
others, but yet lugubrious, as befits your undertaker's man.</p>

<p>He is no anatomical dissector, cutting his subject open, carving its
flesh with the scalpel of his mandibles; he is literally a
grave-digger, a sexton. While the others&mdash;Silphæ, Dermestes,
Cellar-beetles&mdash;gorge themselves with the exploited flesh, without,
of course, forgetting the interests of the family, he, a frugal
eater, hardly touches his find on his own account. He buries it
entire, on the spot, in a cellar where the thing, duly ripened, will
form the diet of his larvæ. He buries it in order to establish his
progeny.</p>

<p>This hoarder of dead bodies, with his stiff and almost heavy
movements, is astonishingly quick at storing away wreckage. In a
shift of a few hours, a comparatively enormous animal, a Mole, for
instance, disappears, engulfed by the earth. The others leave the
dried, emptied carcass to the air, the sport of the winds for months
on end; he, treating it as a whole, makes a clean job of things at
once. No visible trace of his work remains but a tiny hillock, a
burial-mound, a tumulus.</p>

<p>With his expeditious method, the Necrophorus is the first of the
little purifiers of the <a name="page298"></a>fields. He is also one of the most celebrated
of insects in respect of his psychical capacities. This undertaker is
endowed, they say, with intellectual faculties approaching to reason,
such as are not possessed by the most gifted of the Bees and Wasps,
the collectors of honey or game. He is honoured by the two following
anecdotes, which I quote from Lacordaire's<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small> <i>Introduction a
l'entomologie</i>, the only general treatise at my disposal:</p>
<br>
<p>"Clairville," says the author, "reports that he saw a <i>Necrophorus
vespillo</i>, who, wishing to bury a dead Mouse and finding the soil on
which the body lay too hard, went to dig a hole at some distance, in
soil more easily displaced. This operation completed, he attempted to
bury the Mouse in the cavity, but, not succeeding, he flew away and
returned a few moments later, accompanied by four of his fellows, who
assisted him to move the Mouse and bury it."</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> Jean Théodore Lacordaire (1801-1870), author of <i>Genera
des coléoptères</i> (1854-1876) and of the work quoted above
(1837-1839).&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>
<br>
<p>In such actions, Lacordaire adds, we cannot refuse to admit the
intervention of reason.</p>
<br><a name="page299"></a>
<p>"The following case," he continues, "recorded by Gleditsch,<small><small><sup>6</sup></small></small> has
also every indication of the intervention of reason. One of his
friends, wishing to desiccate a Frog, placed it on the top of a stick
thrust into the ground, in order to make sure that the Necrophori
should not come and carry it off. But this precaution was of no
effect; the insects, being unable to reach the Frog, dug under the
stick and, having caused it to fall, buried it as well as the
body."<small><small><sup>7</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>6</sup></small> Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch (1714-1786), the German
botanist.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>7</sup></small> <i>Suites à Buffon. Introduction a l'entomologie</i>, vol.
ii., pp. 460-61.&mdash;<i>Author's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>
<br>
<p>To grant, in the intellect of the insect, a lucid understanding of
the relations between cause and effect, between the end and the
means, is to make a statement of serious import. I know of scarcely
any more suited to the philosophical brutalities of my time. But are
these two anecdotes really true? Do they involve the consequences
deduced from them? Are not those who accept them as sound evidence
just a little too simple?</p>

<p>To be sure, simplicity is needed in entomology. Without a good dose
of this quality, a mental defect in the eyes of practical folk, who
would busy himself with the lesser <a name="page300"></a>creatures? Yes, let us be simple,
without being childishly credulous. Before making insects reason, let
us reason a little ourselves; let us, above all, consult the
experimental test. A fact gathered at random, without criticism,
cannot establish a law.</p>

<p>I do not propose, O valiant grave-diggers, to depreciate your merits;
such is far from being my intention. I have that in my notes, on the
other hand, which will do you more honour than the story of the
gibbet and the Frog; I have gleaned, for your benefit, examples of
prowess which will shed a new lustre upon your reputation.</p>

<p>No, my intention is not to belittle your renown. Besides, it is not
the business of impartial history to maintain a given thesis; it
follows facts. I wish simply to question you upon the power of logic
attributed to you. Do you or do you not enjoy gleams of reason? Have
you within you the humble germ of human thought? That is the problem
before us.</p>

<p>To solve it we will not rely upon the accidents which good fortune
may now and again procure for us. We must employ the breeding-cage,
which will permit of assiduous visits, continuous enquiry and a
variety of artifices. But how to stock the cage? The <a name="page301"></a>land of the
olive-tree is not rich in Necrophori. To my knowledge it possesses
only a single species, <i>N. vestigator</i>, HERSCH.; and even this rival
of the grave-diggers of the north is pretty scarce. The discovery of
three or four in the spring was as much as my hunting-expeditions
yielded in the old days. This time, if I do not resort to the ruses
of the trapper, I shall obtain no more than that, whereas I stand in
need of at least a dozen.</p>

<p>These ruses are very simple. To go in search of the sexton, who
exists only here and there in the country-side, would be nearly
always a waste of time; the favourable month, April, would be past
before my cage was suitably stocked. To run after him is to trust too
much to accident; so we will make him come to us by scattering in the
orchard an abundant collection of dead Moles. To this carrion,
ripened by the sun, the insect will not fail to hasten from the
various points of the horizon, so accomplished is he in detecting
such a delicacy.</p>

<p>I make an arrangement with a gardener in the neighbourhood, who, two
or three times a week, makes up for the penury of my two acres of
stony ground by providing me with vegetables raised in a better soil.
<a name="page302"></a>I explain to him my urgent need of Moles in unlimited numbers.
Battling daily with trap and spade against the importunate excavator
who uproots his crops, he is in a better position than any one to
procure for me what I regard for the moment as more precious than his
bunches of asparagus or his white-heart cabbages.</p>

<p>The worthy man at first laughs at my request, being greatly surprised
by the importance which I attribute to the abhorrent animal, the
<i>Darboun;</i> but at last he consents, not without a suspicion at the
back of his mind that I am going to make myself a gorgeous winter
waist-coat with the soft, velvety skins of the Moles. A thing like
that must be good for pains in the back. Very well. We settle the
matter. The essential thing is that the <i>Darbouns</i> reach me.</p>

<p>They reach me punctually, by twos, by threes, by fours, packed in a
few cabbage-leaves, at the bottom of the gardener's basket. The
excellent fellow who lent himself with such good grace to my strange
wishes will never guess how much comparative psychology will owe him!
In a few days I was the possessor of thirty Moles, which were
scattered here and there, as they reached me, in bare spots of the
orchard, among the <a name="page303"></a>rosemary-bushes, the strawberry-trees and the
lavender-beds.</p>

<p>Now it only remained to wait and to examine, several times a day, the
under-side of my little corpses, a disgusting task which any one
would avoid whose veins were not filled with the sacred fire of
enthusiasm. Only little Paul, of all the household, lent me the aid
of his nimble hand to seize the fugitives. I have already said that
the entomologist needs simplicity of mind. In this important business
of the Necrophori, my assistants were a small boy and an illiterate.</p>

<p>Little Paul's visits alternating with mine, we had not long to wait.
The four winds of heaven bore forth in all directions the odour of
the carrion; and the undertakers hurried up, so that the experiments,
begun with four subjects, were continued with fourteen, a number not
attained during the whole of my previous searches, which were
unpremeditated and in which no bait was used as decoy. My trapper's
ruse was completely successful.</p>

<p>Before I report the results obtained in the cage, let us stop for a
moment to consider the normal conditions of the labours that fall to
the lot of the Necrophori. The Beetle does not select his head of
game, <a name="page304"></a>choosing one in proportion to his strength, as do the Hunting
Wasps; he accepts what chance offers. Among his finds some are small,
such as the Shrew-mouse; some medium-sized, such as the Field-mouse;
some enormous, such as the Mole, the Sewer-rat and the Snake, any of
which exceeds the digging-powers of a single sexton. In the majority
of cases, transportation is impossible, so greatly disproportioned is
the burden to the motive-power. A slight displacement, caused by the
effort of the insects' backs, is all that can possibly be effected.</p>

<p>Ammophila and Cerceris,<small><small><sup>8</sup></small></small> Sphex and Pompilus excavate their burrows
wherever they please; they carry their prey on the wing, or, if too
heavy, drag it afoot. The Necrophorus knows no such facilities in his
task. Incapable of carting the monstrous corpse, no matter where
encountered, he is forced to dig the grave where the body lies.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>8</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Hunting Wasps:</i> chaps. i. to
iii.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>This obligatory place of sepulture may be in stony soil or in
shifting sand; it may occupy this or that bare spot, or some other
where the grass, especially the couch-grass, plunges into the ground
its inextricable network of little cords. There is a great
<a name="page305"></a>probability, too, that a bristle of stunted brambles may be
supporting the body at some inches above the soil. Slung by the
labourer's spade, which has just broken his back, the Mole falls
here, there, anywhere, at random; and where the body falls, no matter
what the obstacles, provided that they be not insurmountable, there
the undertaker must utilize it.</p>

<p>The difficulties of inhumation are capable of such variety as causes
us already to foresee that the Necrophorus cannot employ fixed
methods in performing his task. Exposed to fortuitous hazards, he
must be able to modify his tactics within the limits of his modest
discernment. To saw, to break, to disentangle, to lift, to shake, to
displace: these are so many means which are indispensable to the
grave-digger in a predicament. Deprived of these resources, reduced
to uniformity of procedure, the insect would be incapable of pursuing
its calling.</p>

<p>We see at once how imprudent it would be to draw conclusions from an
isolated case in which rational co-ordination or premeditated
intention might appear to play its part. Every instinctive action no
doubt has its motive; but does the animal in the first place judge
whether the action is opportune? Let <a name="page306"></a>us begin by a careful
consideration of the creature's labours; let us support each piece of
evidence by others; and then we shall perhaps be able to answer the
question.</p>

<p>First of all, a word as to diet. A general scavenger, the
Burying-beetle refuses no sort of cadaveric putrescence. All is good
to his senses, feathered game or furry, provided that the burden do
not exceed his strength. He exploits the batrachian or the reptile
with no less animation. He accepts without hesitation extraordinary
finds, probably unknown to his race, as witness a certain Goldfish, a
red Chinese Carp, whose body, placed in one of my cages, was
forthwith considered an excellent tit-bit and buried according to the
rules. Nor is butcher's meat despised. A mutton-cutlet, a strip of
beef-steak, in the right stage of maturity, disappeared beneath the
soil, receiving the same attentions as those lavished on the Mole or
the Mouse. In short, the Necrophorus has no exclusive preferences;
anything putrid he conveys underground.</p>

<p>The maintenance of his industry, therefore, presents no sort of
difficulty. If one kind of game be lacking, some other, the first to
hand, will very well replace it. Nor is there much trouble in fixing
the site of his <a name="page307"></a>industry. A capacious wire-gauze cover, resting on an
earthen pan filled to the brim with fresh, heaped sand, is
sufficient. To obviate criminal attempts on the part of the Cats,
whom the game would not fail to tempt, the cage is installed in a
closed glass-house, which in winter shelters the plants and in summer
serves as an entomological laboratory.</p>

<p>Now to work. The Mole lies in the centre of the enclosure. The soil,
easily shifted and homogeneous, realizes the best conditions for
comfortable work. Four Necrophori, three males and a female, are
there with the body. They remain invisible, hidden beneath the
carcase, which from time to time seems to return to life, shaken from
end to end by the backs of the workers. An observer not in the secret
would be somewhat astonished to see the dead creature move. From time
to time, one of the sextons, almost always a male, comes out and
walks round the animal, which he explores, probing its velvet coat.
He hurriedly returns, appears again, once more investigates and
creeps back under the corpse.</p>

<p>The tremors become more pronounced; the carcase oscillates, while a
cushion of sand, pushed out from below, grows up all around <a name="page308"></a>it. The
Mole, by reason of his own weight and the efforts of the
grave-diggers, who are labouring at their task underneath, gradually
sinks, for lack of support, into the undermined soil.</p>

<p>Presently the sand which has been pushed out quivers under the thrust
of the invisible miners, slips into the pit and covers the interred
Mole. It is a clandestine burial. The body seems to disappear of
itself, as though engulfed by a fluid medium. For a long time yet,
until the depth is regarded as sufficient, the body will continue to
descend.</p>

<p>It is, on the whole, a very simple operation. As the diggers below
deepen the cavity into which the corpse, shaken and tugged above,
sinks without the direct intervention of the sextons, the grave fills
of itself by the mere slipping of the soil. Stout shovels at the tips
of their claws, powerful backs, capable of creating a little
earthquake: the diggers need nothing more for the practice of their
profession. Let us add&mdash;for this is an essential point&mdash;the art of
continually jerking the body, so as to pack it into a lesser volume
and make it glide through difficult passages. We shall soon see that
this art plays a leading part in the industry of the Necrophori.</p>
<a name="page309"></a>
<p>Although he has disappeared, the Mole is still far from having
reached his destination. Let us leave the undertakers to finish their
job. What they are now doing below ground is a continuation of what
they did on the surface and would teach us nothing new. We will wait
for two or three days.</p>

<p>The moment has come. Let us inform ourselves of what is happening
down there. Let us visit the place of corruption. I shall never
invite anybody to the exhumation. Of those about me, only little Paul
has the courage to assist me.</p>

<p>The Mole is a Mole no longer, but a greenish horror, putrid,
hairless, shrunk into a sort of fat, greasy rasher. The thing must
have undergone careful manipulation to be thus condensed into a small
volume, like a fowl in the hands of the cook, and, above all, to be
so completely deprived of its furry coat. Is this culinary procedure
undertaken in respect of the larvæ, which might be incommoded by the
fur? Or is it just a casual result, a mere loss of hair due to
putridity? I am not certain. But it is always the case that these
exhumations, from first to last, have revealed the furry game furless
and the feathered game featherless, except for the <a name="page310"></a>pinion- and
tail-feathers. Reptiles and fish, on the other hand, retain their
scales.</p>

<p>Let us return to the unrecognizable thing that was once a Mole. The
tit-bit lies in a spacious crypt, with firm walls, a regular
workshop, worthy of being the bake-house of a Copris. Except for the
fur, which lies scattered about in flocks, it is intact. The
grave-diggers have not eaten into it: it is the patrimony of the
sons, not the provision of the parents, who, to sustain themselves,
levy at most a few mouthfuls of the ooze of putrid humours.</p>

<p>Beside the dish which they are kneading and protecting are two
Necrophori; a couple, no more. Four collaborated in the burial. What
has become of the other two, both males? I find them hidden in the
soil, at a distance, almost on the surface.</p>

<p>This observation is not an isolated one. Whenever I am present at a
funeral undertaken by a squad in which the males, zealous one and
all, predominate, I find presently, when the burial is completed,
only one couple in the mortuary cellar. After lending their
assistance, the rest have discreetly retired.</p>

<p>These grave-diggers, in truth, are remarkable fathers. They have
nothing of the happy-go-lucky paternal carelessness that is <a name="page311"></a>the
general rule among insects, which pester the mother for a moment with
their attentions and then leave her to care for the offspring! But
those who would be idlers in the other castes here labour valiantly,
now in the interest of their own family, now in that of another's,
without distinction. If a couple is in difficulties, helpers arrive,
attracted by the odour of carrion; anxious to serve a lady, they
creep under the body, work at it with back and claw, bury it and then
go their ways, leaving the master and mistress of the house to their
happiness.</p>

<p>For some time longer these two manipulate the morsel in concert,
stripping it of fur or feather, trussing it and allowing it to simmer
to the grub's taste. When everything is in order, the couple go
forth, dissolving their partnership; and each, following his fancy,
begins again elsewhere, even if only as a mere auxiliary.</p>

<p>Twice and no oftener hitherto have I found the father preoccupied by
the future of his sons and labouring in order to leave them rich: it
happens with certain dung-workers and with the Necrophori, who bury
dead bodies. Scavengers and undertakers both have exemplary morals.
Who would look for virtue in such a quarter?</p>
<a name="page312"></a>
<p>What follows&mdash;the larval existence and the metamorphosis&mdash;is a
secondary and, for that matter, a familiar detail. It is a dry
subject and I will deal with it briefly. At the end of May, I exhume
a Brown Rat, buried by the grave-diggers a fortnight earlier.
Transformed into a black, sticky mass, the horrible dish provides me
with fifteen larvæ already, for the most part, of the normal size. A
few adults, unquestionably connections of the brood, are also
swarming amid the putrescence. The laying-time is over now and
victuals are plentiful. Having nothing else to do, the foster-parents
have sat down to the feast with the nurslings.</p>

<p>The undertakers are quick at rearing a family. It is at most a
fortnight since the Rat was laid in the earth; and here already is a
vigorous population on the verge of the metamorphosis. This precocity
amazes me. It would seem as though carrion liquefaction, deadly to
any other stomach, were in this case a food productive of special
energy, which stimulates the organism and accelerates its growth, so
that the fare may be consumed before its approaching conversion into
mould. Living chemistry makes haste to <a name="page313"></a>outstrip the ultimate
reactions of mineral chemistry.</p>

<p>White, naked, blind, possessing the customary attributes of life
spent in the dark, the larva, with its tapering outline, is slightly
reminiscent of the Ground-beetles'. The mandibles are black and
powerful and make excellent dissecting-scissors. The limbs are short,
but capable of a quick, toddling gait. The segments of the abdomen
are clad on the upper surface in a narrow red plate, armed with four
little spikes, whose office apparently is to furnish points of
support when the larva quits the natal dwelling and dives into the
soil, there to undergo the transformation. The thoracic segments are
provided with wider plates, but unarmed.</p>

<p>The adults discovered in the company of their larval family, in this
putrescence which was a Rat, are all abominably verminous. So shiny
and neat in their attire, when at work under the first Moles of
April, the Necrophori, when June approaches, become odious to look
upon. A layer of parasites envelops them; insinuating itself into the
joints, it forms an almost continuous crust. The insect presents a
misshapen appearance under this overcoat of vermin, which my
<a name="page314"></a>hair-pencil can hardly brush aside. Driven off the belly, the horde
runs round the sufferer, perches on his back and refuses to let go.</p>

<p>I recognize the Beetle's Gamasus, the Tick who so often soils the
ventral amethyst of our Geotrupes. No, life's prizes do not go to the
useful. Necrophori and Geotrupes devote themselves to the general
health; and these two corporations, so interesting in their hygienic
functions, so remarkable for their domestic morals, fall victims to
the vermin of poverty. Alas, of this discrepancy between the services
rendered and the harshness of life there are many other examples
outside the world of scavengers and undertakers!</p>

<p>The Burying-beetles display an exemplary domestic morality, but it
does not continue till the end. In the first fortnight of June, the
family being sufficiently provided, the sextons strike work and my
cages are deserted on the surface, in spite of new arrivals of Mice
and Sparrows. From time to time, some grave-digger leaves the subsoil
and comes crawling languidly into the fresh air.</p>

<p>Another rather curious fact now attracts my attention. All those who
climb up from underground are maimed, with limbs amputated at the
joints, some higher up, some <a name="page315"></a>lower down. I see one cripple who has
only one leg left entire. With this odd limb and the stumps of the
others, lamentably tattered, scaly with vermin, he rows, as it were,
over the sheet of dust. A comrade emerges, better off for legs, who
finishes the invalid and cleans out his abdomen. Thus do my thirteen
remaining Necrophori end their days, half-devoured by their
companions, or at least shorn of several limbs. The pacific relations
of the outset are succeeded by cannibalism.</p>

<p>History tells us that certain peoples, the Massagetæ and others, used
to kill off their old men to save them from senile misery. The fatal
blow on the hoary skull was in their eyes an act of filial piety. The
Necrophori have their share of these ancient barbarities. Full of
days and henceforth useless, dragging out a weary existence, they
mutually exterminate one another. Why prolong the agony of the
impotent and the imbecile?</p>

<p>The Massagetæ might plead, as an excuse for their atrocious custom, a
dearth of provisions, which is an evil counsellor; not so the
Necrophori, for, thanks to my generosity, victuals are more than
plentiful, both beneath the soil and on the surface. Famine <a name="page316"></a>plays no
part in this slaughter. What we see is an aberration due to
exhaustion, the morbid fury of a life on the point of extinction. As
is generally the case, work bestows a peaceable disposition on the
grave-digger, while inaction inspires him with perverted tastes.
Having nothing left to do, he breaks his kinsman's limbs and eats him
up, heedless of being maimed or eaten himself. It is the final
deliverance of verminous old age.</p>

<p>This murderous frenzy, breaking out late in life, is not peculiar to
the Necrophorus. I have described elsewhere the perversity of the
Osmia, so placid in the beginning. Feeling her ovaries exhausted, she
smashes her neighbours' cells and even her own; she scatters the
dusty honey, rips open the egg, eats it. The Mantis devours the
lovers who have played their parts; the mother Decticus willingly
nibbles a thigh of her decrepit husband; the merry Crickets, once the
eggs are laid in the ground, indulge in tragic domestic quarrels and
with not the least compunction slash open one another's bellies. When
the cares of the family are finished, the joys of life are finished
likewise. The insect then sometimes becomes depraved; and its
disordered mechanism ends in aberrations.</p>

<p>The larva has nothing striking to show in <a name="page317"></a>the way of industry. When
it has fattened to the desired extent, it leaves the charnel-house of
the natal crypt and descends into the earth, far from the
putrefaction. Here, working with its legs and its dorsal armour, it
presses back the sand around it and makes itself a close cabin
wherein to rest for the metamorphosis. When the lodge is ready and
the torpor of the approaching moult arrives, it lies inert; but, at
the least alarm, it comes to life and turns round on its axis.</p>

<p>Even so do several nymphs spin round and round when disturbed,
notably that of <i>Ægosomus scabricornis</i> which I have now before my
eyes in July. It is always a fresh surprise to see these mummies
suddenly throw off their immobility and gyrate on their own axis with
a mechanism whose secret deserves to be fathomed. The science of
rational mechanics might find something here to whet its finest
theories upon. The strength and litheness of a clown cannot compare
with those of this budding flesh, this hardly coagulated glair.</p>

<p>Once isolated in its cell, the larva of the Necrophorus becomes a
nymph in ten days or so. I lack the evidence furnished by direct
observation, but the story is completed of itself. The Necrophorus
must assume <a name="page318"></a>the adult form in the course of the summer; like the
Dung-beetle, he must enjoy in the autumn a few days of revelry free
from family cares. Then, when the cold weather draws near, he goes to
earth in his winter quarters, whence he emerges as soon as spring
arrives.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<center>THE BURYING-BEETLES: EXPERIMENTS</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>Let us come to the feats of reason which have earned for the
Necrophorus the best part of his fame and, to begin with, submit the
case related by Clairville, that of the too hard soil and the call
for assistance, to the test of experiment.</p>

<p>With this object I pave the centre of the space beneath the cover,
flush with the soil, with a brick, which I sprinkle with a thin layer
of sand. This will be the soil that cannot be dug. All around it, for
some distance and on the same level, lies the loose soil, which is
easy to delve.</p>

<p>In order to approach the conditions of the anecdote, I must have a
Mouse; with a Mole, a heavy mass, the removal would perhaps present
too much difficulty. To obtain one, I place my friends and neighbours
under requisition; they laugh at my whim but none the less proffer
their traps. Yet, the moment a very common thing is needed, it
becomes rare. Defying decency in his speech, after the manner of his
ancestors' Latin, the <a name="page320"></a>Provençal says, but even more crudely than in
my translation:</p>

<p>"If you look for dung, the Donkeys become constipated!"</p>

<p>At last I possess the Mouse of my dreams! She comes to me from that
refuge, furnished with a truss of straw, in which official charity
grants a day's hospitality to the pauper wandering over the face of
the fertile earth, from that municipal hostel whence one inevitably
issues covered with Lice. O Réaumur,<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> who used to invite
marchionesses to see your caterpillars change their skins, what would
you have said of a future disciple conversant with such squalor as
this? Perhaps it is well that we should not be ignorant of it, so
that we may have compassion with that of the beast.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur (1683-1757), the
inventor of the Réaumur thermometer and author of <i>Mémoires pour
servir à l'histoire naturelle des insectes</i>
(1734-1742).&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The Mouse so greatly desired is mine. I place her upon the centre of
the brick. The grave-diggers under the wire cover are now seven in
number, including three females. All have gone to earth; some are
inactive, close to the surface; the rest are busy in their crypts.
The presence of the <a name="page321"></a>fresh corpse is soon perceived. About seven
o'clock in the morning, three Necrophori come hurrying up, two males
and a female. They slip under the Mouse, who moves in jerks, a sign
of the efforts of the burying-party. An attempt is made to dig into
the layer of sand which hides the brick, so that a bank of rubbish
accumulates round the body.</p>

<p>For a couple of hours the jerks continue without results. I profit by
the circumstance to learn the manner in which the work is performed.
The bare brick allows me to see what the excavated soil would conceal
from me. When it is necessary to move the body, the Beetle turns
over; with his six claws he grips the hair of the dead animal, props
himself upon his back and pushes, using his forehead and the tip of
his abdomen as a lever. When he wants to dig, he resumes the normal
position. So, turn and turn about, the sexton strives, now with his
legs in the air, when it is a question of shifting the body or
dragging it lower down; now with his feet on the ground, when it is
necessary to enlarge the grave.</p>

<p>The point at which the Mouse lies is finally recognized as
unassailable. A male appears in the open. He explores the <a name="page322"></a>corpse,
goes round it, scratches a little at random. He goes back; and
immediately the dead body rocks. Is he advising his collaborators of
what he has discovered? Is he arranging the work with a view to their
establishing themselves elsewhere, on propitious soil?</p>

<p>The facts are far from confirming this idea. When he shakes the body,
the others imitate him and push, but without combining their efforts
in a given direction, for, after advancing a little towards the edge
of the brick, the burden goes back again, returning to the point of
departure. In the absence of a concerted understanding, their efforts
of leverage are wasted. Nearly three hours are occupied by
oscillations which mutually annul one another. The Mouse does not
cross the little sand-hill heaped about her by the rakes of the
workers.</p>

<p>For the second time, a male appears and makes a round of exploration.
A boring is effected in loose earth, close beside the brick. This is
a trial excavation, to learn the nature of the soil, a narrow well,
of no great depth, into which the insect plunges to half its length.
The well-sinker returns to the other workers, who arch their backs,
and the load progresses a finger's-breadth towards <a name="page323"></a>the point
recognized as favourable. Have we done the trick this time? No, for
after a while the Mouse recoils. There is no progress towards a
solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p>Now two males come out in search of information, each of his own
accord. Instead of stopping at the point already sounded, a point
most judiciously chosen, it seemed, on account of its proximity,
which would save laborious carting, they precipitately scour the
whole area of the cage, trying the soil on this side and on that and
ploughing superficial furrows in it. They get as far from the brick
as the limits of the enclosure permit.</p>

<p>They dig, by preference, against the base of the cover; here they
make several borings, without any reason, so far as I can see, the
bed of soil being everywhere equally assailable away from the brick;
the first point sounded is abandoned for a second, which is rejected
in its turn. A third and fourth are tried; then another. At the sixth
point the choice is made. In all these cases the excavation is by no
means a grave destined to receive the Mouse, but a mere trial boring,
of inconsiderable depth and of the diameter of the digger's body.</p>

<p>Back again to the Mouse, who suddenly <a name="page324"></a>shakes, swings, advances,
recoils, first in one direction, then in another, until in the end
the hillock of sand is crossed. Now we are free of the brick and on
excellent soil. Little by little the load advances. This is no
cartage by a team hauling in the open, but a jerky removal, the work
of invisible levers. The body seems to shift of its own accord.</p>

<p>This time, after all those hesitations, the efforts are concerted; at
least, the load reaches the region sounded far more rapidly than I
expected. Then begins the burial, according to the usual method. It
is one o'clock. It has taken the Necrophori halfway round the clock
to ascertain the condition of the locality and to displace the Mouse.</p>

<p>In this experiment it appears, in the first place, that the males
play a major part in the affairs of the household. Better-equipped,
perhaps, than their mates, they make investigations when a difficulty
occurs; they inspect the soil, recognize whence the check arises and
choose the spot at which the grave shall be dug. In the lengthy
experiment of the brick, the two males alone explored the
surroundings and set to work to solve the difficulty. Trusting her
assistants, the female, motionless beneath the Mouse, awaited the
result of their enquiries. The <a name="page325"></a>tests which are to follow will confirm
the merits of these valiant auxiliaries.</p>

<p>In the second place, the points where the Mouse lies being recognized
as presenting an insurmountable resistance, there is no grave dug in
advance, a little farther off, in the loose soil. All the attempts
are limited, I repeat, to shallow soundings, which inform the insect
of the possibility of inhumation.</p>

<p>It is absolute nonsense to speak of their first preparing the grave
to which the body will afterwards be carted. In order to excavate the
soil, our sextons have to feel the weight of their dead upon their
backs. They work only when stimulated by the contact of its fur.
Never, never in this world, do they venture to dig a grave unless the
body to be buried already occupies the site of the cavity. This is
absolutely confirmed by my two months and more of daily observations.</p>

<p>The rest of Clairville's anecdote bears examination no better. We are
told that the Necrophorus in difficulties goes in search of
assistance and returns with companions who assist him to bury the
Mouse. This, in another form, is the edifying story of the Sacred
Beetle whose pellet has rolled into a rut. Powerless to withdraw his
booty from the <a name="page326"></a>abyss, the wily Dung-beetle summons three or four of
his neighbours, who kindly pull out the pellet and return to their
labours when the work of salvage is done.<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> For the confutation of this theory, cf. <i>The Sacred
Beetle and Others:</i> chap. i.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The ill-interpreted exploit of the thieving pill-roller sets me on my
guard against that of the undertaker. Shall I be too particular if I
ask what precautions the observer took to recognize the owner of the
Mouse on his return, when he reappears, as we are told, with four
assistants? What sign denotes that one of the five who was able, in
so rational a manner, to call for help? Can we even be sure that the
one to disappear returns and forms one of the band? There is nothing
to tell us so; and this was the essential point which a sterling
observer was bound not to neglect. Were they not rather five chance
Necrophori who, guided by the smell, without any previous
understanding, hastened to the abandoned Mouse to exploit her on
their own account? I incline to this opinion, the likeliest of all in
the absence of exact information.</p>

<p>Probability becomes certainty if we check the fact by experiment. The
test with the <a name="page327"></a>brick already tells us something. For six hours my
three specimens exhausted themselves in efforts before they succeeded
in removing their booty and placing it on practicable soil. In this
long and heavy job, helpful neighbours would have been most welcome.
Four other Necrophori, buried here and there under a little sand,
comrades and acquaintances, fellow-workers of the day before, were
occupying the same cage; and not one of the busy ones thought of
calling on them to assist. Despite their extreme embarrassment, the
owners of the Mouse accomplished their task to the end, without the
least help, though this could have been so easily requisitioned.</p>

<p>Being three, one might say, they deemed themselves strong enough;
they needed no one else to lend them a hand. The objection does not
hold good. On many occasions and under conditions even more difficult
than those presented by a hard soil, I have again and again seen
isolated Necrophori wearing themselves out against my artifices; yet
not once did they leave their workshop to recruit helpers.
Collaborators, it is true, often arrive, but they are summoned by
their sense of smell, not by the first occupant. They are fortuitous
helpers; they are never called <a name="page328"></a>in. They are received without strife
but also without gratitude. They are not summoned; they are
tolerated.</p>

<p>In the glazed shelter where I keep the cage I happened to catch one
of these chance assistants in the act. Passing that way in the night
and scenting dead flesh, he had entered where none of his kind had
yet penetrated of his own accord. I surprised him on the dome of the
cover. If the wire had not prevented him, he would have set to work
incontinently, in company with the rest. Had my captives invited this
one? Assuredly not. Heedless of others' efforts, he hastened up,
attracted by the odour of the Mole. So it was with those whose
obliging assistance is extolled. I repeat, in respect of their
imaginary prowess, what I have said elsewhere of the Sacred Beetle's:
it is a child's story, worthy to rank with any fairytale for the
amusement of the simple.</p>

<p>A hard soil, necessitating the removal of the body, is not the only
difficulty with which the Necrophori are acquainted. Frequently,
perhaps more often than not, the ground is covered with grass, above
all with couch-grass, whose tenacious rootlets form an inextricable
network below the surface. To dig in the interstices is possible, but
to drag <a name="page329"></a>the dead animal through them is another matter: the meshes of
the net are too close to give it passage. Will the grave-digger find
himself helpless against such an obstacle, which must be an extremely
common one? That could not be.</p>

<p>Exposed to this or that habitual impediment in the exercise of its
calling, the animal is always equipped accordingly; otherwise its
profession would be impracticable. No end is attained without the
necessary means and aptitudes. Besides that of the excavator, the
Necrophorus certainly possesses another art: the art of breaking the
cables, the roots, the stolons, the slender rhizomes which check the
body's descent into the grave. To the work of the shovel and the pick
must be added that of the shears. All this is perfectly logical and
may be clearly foreseen. Nevertheless, let us call in experiment, the
best of witnesses.</p>

<p>I borrow from the kitchen-range an iron trivet whose legs will supply
a solid foundation for the engine which I am devising. This is a
coarse network made of strips of raffia, a fairly accurate imitation
of that of the couch-grass. The very irregular meshes are nowhere
wide enough to admit of the passage of the creature to be buried,
which <a name="page330"></a>this time is a Mole. The machine is planted by its three feet
in the soil of the cage, level with the surface. A little sand
conceals the ropes. The Mole is placed in the centre; and my bands of
sextons are let loose upon the body.</p>

<p>The burial is performed without a hitch in the course of an
afternoon. The raffia hammock, almost the equivalent of the natural
network of the couch-grass, scarcely disturbs the burying-process.
Matters do not proceed quite so quickly; and that is all. No attempt
is made to shift the Mole, who sinks into the ground where he lies.
When the operation is finished, I remove the trivet. The network is
broken at the spot where the corpse was lying. A few strips have been
gnawed through; a small number, only as many as were strictly
necessary to permit the passage of the body.</p>

<p>Well done, my undertakers! I expected no less of your skill and tact.
You foiled the experimenter's wiles by employing the resources which
you use against natural obstacles. With mandibles for shears, you
patiently cut my strings as you would have gnawed the threads of the
grass-roots. This is meritorious, if not deserving of exceptional
glorification. The shallowest of the <a name="page331"></a>insects that work in earth would
have done as much if subjected to similar conditions.</p>

<p>Let us ascend a stage in the series of difficulties. The Mole is now
fixed by a strap of raffia fore and aft to a light horizontal
cross-bar resting on two firmly-planted forks. It is like a joint of
venison on the spit, eccentrically fastened. The dead animal touches
the ground throughout the length of its body.</p>

<p>The Necrophori disappear under the corpse and, feeling the contact of
its fur, begin to dig. The grave grows deeper and an empty space
appears; but the coveted object does not descend, retained as it is
by the cross-bar which the two forks keep in place. The digging
slackens, the hesitations become prolonged.</p>

<p>However, one of the grave-diggers climbs to the surface, wanders over
the Mole, inspects him and ends by perceiving the strap at the back.
He gnaws and ravels it tenaciously. I hear the click of the shears
that completes the rupture. Crack! The thing is done. Dragged down by
his own weight, the Mole sinks into the grave, but slantwise, with
his head still outside, kept in place by the second strap.</p>

<p>The Beetles proceed with the burial of the <a name="page332"></a>hinder part of the Mole;
they twitch and jerk it now in this direction, now in that. Nothing
comes of it; the thing refuses to give. A fresh sortie is made by one
of them, to find out what is happening overhead. The second strap is
perceived, is severed in turn; and henceforth the work goes on as
well as could be wished.</p>

<p>My compliments, perspicacious cable-cutters! But I must not
exaggerate. The Mole's straps were for you the little cords with
which you are so familiar in turfy soil. You broke them, as well as
the hammock of the previous experiment, just as you sever with the
blades of your shears any natural thread stretching across your
catacombs. It is an indispensable trick of your trade. If you had had
to learn it by experience, to think it out before practising it, your
race would have disappeared, killed by the hesitations of its
apprenticeship, for the spots prolific of Moles, Frogs, Lizards and
other viands to your taste are usually covered with grass.</p>

<p>You are capable of much better things still; but, before setting
forth these, let us examine the case when the ground bristles with
slender brushwood, which holds the corpse at a short distance from
the ground. <a name="page333"></a>Will the find thus hanging where it chances to fall
remain unemployed? Will the Necrophori pass on, indifferent to the
superb morsel which they see and smell a few inches above their
heads, or will they make it drop from its gibbet?</p>

<p>Game does not abound to such a point that it can be despised if a few
efforts will obtain it. Before I see the thing happen, I am persuaded
that it will fall, that the Necrophori, often confronted with the
difficulties of a body not lying on the soil, must possess the
instinct to shake it to the ground. The fortuitous support of a few
bits of stubble, of a few interlaced twigs, so common in the fields,
cannot put them off. The drop of the suspended body, if placed too
high, must certainly form part of their instinctive methods. For the
rest, let us watch them at work.</p>

<p>I plant in the sand of the cage a meagre tuft of thyme. The shrub is
at most some four inches in height. In the branches I place a Mouse,
entangling the tail, the paws and the neck among the twigs to
increase the difficulty. The population of the cage now consists of
fourteen Necrophori and will remain the same until the close of my
investigations. Of course they do not all take part <a name="page334"></a>simultaneously in
the day's work: the majority remain underground, dozing or occupied
in setting their cellars in order. Sometimes only one, often two,
three or four, rarely more, busy themselves with the corpse which I
offer them. To-day, two hasten to the Mouse, who is soon perceived
overhead on the tuft of thyme.</p>

<p>They gain the top of the plant by way of the trelliswork of the cage.
Here are repeated, with increased hesitation, due to the inconvenient
nature of the support, the tactics employed to remove the body when
the soil is unfavourable. The insect props itself against a branch,
thrusting alternately with back and claws, jerking and shaking
vigorously until the point whereat it is working is freed from its
fetters. In one brief shift, by dint of heaving their backs, the two
collaborators extricate the body from the tangle. Yet another shake;
and the Mouse is down. The burial follows.</p>

<p>There is nothing new in this experiment: the find has been treated
just as though it lay on soil unsuitable for burial. The fall is the
result of an attempt to transport the load.</p>

<p>The time has come to set up the Frog's gibbet made famous by
Gleditsch. The <a name="page335"></a>batrachian is not indispensable; a Mole will serve as
well or even better. With a ligament of raffia I fix him, by his
hind-legs, to a twig which I plant vertically in the ground,
inserting it to no great depth. The creature hangs plumb against the
gibbet, its head and shoulders making ample contact with the soil.</p>

<p>The grave-diggers set to work beneath the part which lies along the
ground, at the very foot of the stake; they dig a funnel into which
the Mole's muzzle, head and neck sink little by little. The gibbet
becomes uprooted as they descend and ends by falling, dragged over by
the weight of its heavy burden. I am assisting at the spectacle of
the overturned stake, one of the most astonishing feats of reason
with which the insect has ever been credited.</p>

<p>This, for one who is considering the problem of instinct, is an
exciting moment. But let us beware of forming conclusions just yet;
we might be in too great a hurry. Let us first ask ourselves whether
the fall of the stake was intentional or accidental. Did the
Necrophori lay it bare with the express purpose of making it fall? Or
did they, on the contrary, dig at its base solely in order to bury
that part of the Mole which lay on <a name="page336"></a>the ground? That is the question,
which, for the rest, is very easy to answer.</p>

<p>The experiment is repeated; but this time the gibbet is slanting and
the Mole, hanging in a vertical position, touches the ground at a
couple of inches from the base of the apparatus. Under these
conditions, absolutely no attempt is made to overthrow it. Not the
least scrape of a claw is delivered at the foot of the gibbet. The
entire work of excavation is performed at a distance, under the body,
whose shoulders are lying on the ground. Here and here only a hole is
dug to receive the front of the body, the part accessible to the
sextons.</p>

<p>A difference of an inch in the position of the suspended animal
destroys the famous legend. Even so, many a time, the most elementary
sieve, handled with a little logic, is enough to winnow a confused
mass of statements and to release the good grain of truth.</p>

<p>Yet another shake of this sieve. The gibbet is slanting or
perpendicular, no matter which; but the Mole, fixed by his hind-legs
to the top of the twig, does not touch the soil; he hangs a few
fingers'-breadths from the ground, out of the sextons' reach.</p>

<p>What will they do now? Will they <a name="page337"></a>scrape at the foot of the gibbet in
order to overturn it? By no means; and the ingenuous observer who
looked for such tactics would be greatly disappointed. No attention
is paid to the base of the support. It is not vouchsafed even a
stroke of the rake. Nothing is done to overturn it, nothing,
absolutely nothing! It is by other methods that the Burying-beetles
obtain the Mole.</p>

<p>These decisive experiments, repeated under many different forms,
prove that never, never in this world, do the Necrophori dig, or even
give a superficial scrape, at the foot of the gallows, unless the
hanging body touch the ground at that point. And, in the latter case,
if the twig should happen to fall, this is in no way an intentional
result, but a mere fortuitous effect of the burial already commenced.</p>

<p>What, then, did the man with the Frog, of whom Gleditsch tells us,
really see? If his stick was overturned, the body placed to dry
beyond the assaults of the Necrophori must certainly have touched the
soil: a strange precaution against robbers and damp! We may well
attribute more foresight to the preparer of dried Frogs and allow him
to hang his animal a few inches off the ground. In that case, as all
my <a name="page338"></a>experiments emphatically declare, the fall of the stake undermined
by the sextons is a pure matter of imagination.</p>

<p>Yet another of the fine arguments in favour of the reasoning-power of
insects flies from the light of investigation and founders in the
slough of error! I wonder at your simple faith, O masters who take
seriously the statements of chance-met observers, richer in
imagination than in veracity; I wonder at your credulous zeal, when,
without criticism, you build up your theories on such absurdities!</p>

<p>Let us continue. The stake is henceforth planted perpendicularly, but
the body hanging on it does not reach the base: a condition enough to
ensure that there will never be any digging at this point. I make use
of a Mouse, who, by reason of her light weight, will lend herself
better to the insect's manoeuvres. The dead animal is fixed by the
hind-legs to the top of the apparatus with a raffia strap. It hangs
plumb, touching the stick.</p>

<p>Soon two Necrophori have discovered the morsel. They climb the
greased pole; they explore the prize, poking their foreheads into its
fur. It is recognized as an excellent find. To work, therefore. Here
we have again, <a name="page339"></a>but under more difficult conditions, the tactics
employed when it was necessary to displace the unfavourably situated
body: the two collaborators slip between the Mouse and the stake and,
taking a grip of the twig and exerting a leverage with their backs,
they jerk and shake the corpse, which sways, twirls about, swings
away from the stake and swings back again. All the morning is passed
in vain attempts, interrupted by explorations on the animal's body.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the cause of the check is at last recognized; not
very clearly, for the two obstinate gallow-robbers first attack the
Mouse's hind-legs, a little way below the strap. They strip them
bare, flay them and cut away the flesh about the foot. They have
reached the bone, when one of them finds the string of raffia beneath
his mandibles. This, to him, is a familiar thing, representing the
grass-thread so frequent in burials in turfy soil. Tenaciously the
shears gnaw at the bond; the fibrous fetter is broken; and the Mouse
falls, to be buried soon after.</p>

<p>If it stood alone, this breaking of the suspending tie would be a
magnificent performance; but considered in connection with the sum of
the Beetle's customary labours it <a name="page340"></a>loses any far-reaching
significance. Before attacking the strap, which was not concealed in
any way, the insect exerted itself for a whole morning in shaking the
body, its usual method. In the end, finding the cord, it broke it, as
it would have broken a thread of couch-grass encountered underground.</p>

<p>Under the conditions devised for the Beetle, the use of the shears is
the indispensable complement of the use of the shovel; and the
modicum of discernment at his disposal is enough to inform him when
it will be well to employ the clippers. He cuts what embarrasses him,
with no more exercise of reason than he displays when lowering his
dead Mouse underground. So little does he grasp the relation of cause
and effect that he tries to break the bone of the leg before biting
the raffia which is knotted close beside him. The difficult task is
attempted before the extremely easy one.</p>

<p>Difficult, yes, but not impossible, provided that the Mouse be young.
I begin over again with a strip of iron wire, on which the insect's
shears cannot get a grip, and a tender Mousekin, half the size of an
adult. This time a tibia is gnawed through, sawed in two by the
Beetle's mandibles, near the spring of the heel. The detached leg
leaves <a name="page341"></a>plenty of space for the other, which readily slips from the
metal band; and the little corpse falls to the ground.</p>

<p>But, if the bone be too hard, if the prize suspended be a Mole, an
adult Mouse or a Sparrow, the wire ligament opposes an insurmountable
obstacle to the attempts of the Necrophori, who, for nearly a week,
work at the hanging body, partly stripping it of fur or feather and
dishevelling it until it forms a lamentable object, and at last
abandon it when desiccation sets in. And yet a last resource
remained, one as rational as infallible: to overthrow the stake. Of
course, not one dreams of doing so.</p>

<p>For the last time let us change our artifices. The top of the gibbet
consists of a little fork, with the prongs widely opened and
measuring barely two-fifths of an inch in length. With a thread of
hemp, less easily attacked than a strip of raffia, I bind the
hind-legs of an adult Mouse together, a little above the heels; and I
slip one of the prongs in between. To bring the thing down one has
only to slide it a little way upwards; it is like a young Rabbit
hanging in the window of a poulterer's shop.</p>

<p>Five Necrophori come to inspect what I have prepared. After much
futile shaking, <a name="page342"></a>the tibiæ are attacked. This, it seems, is the method
usually employed when the corpse is caught by one of its limbs in
some narrow fork of a low-growing plant. While trying to saw through
the bone&mdash;a heavy job this time&mdash;one of the workers slips between the
shackled legs; in this position, he feels the furry touch of the
Mouse against his chine. No more is needed to arouse his propensity
to thrust with his back. With a few heaves of the lever the thing is
done: the Mouse rises a little, slides over the supporting peg and
falls to the ground.</p>

<p>Is this manoeuvre really thought out? Has the insect indeed
perceived, by the light of a flash of reason, that to make the morsel
fall it was necessary to unhook it by sliding it along the peg? Has
it actually perceived the mechanism of the hanging? I know some
persons&mdash;indeed, I know many&mdash;who, in the presence of this
magnificent result, would be satisfied without further investigation.</p>

<p>More difficult to convince, I modify the experiment before drawing a
conclusion. I suspect that the Necrophorus, without in any way
foreseeing the consequences of his action, heaved his back merely
because he felt the animal's legs above him. With the <a name="page343"></a>system of
suspension adopted, the push of the back, employed in all cases of
difficulty, was brought to bear first upon the point of support; and
the fall resulted from this happy coincidence. That point, which has
to be slipped along the peg in order to unhook the object, ought
really to be placed at a short distance from the Mouse, so that the
Necrophori may no longer feel her directly on their backs when they
push.</p>

<p>A wire binds together now the claws of a Sparrow, now the heels of a
Mouse and is bent, three-quarters of an inch farther away, into a
little ring, which slips very loosely over one of the prongs of the
fork, a short, almost horizontal prong. The least push of this ring
is enough to bring the hanging body to the ground; and because it
stands out it lends itself excellently to the insect's methods. In
short, the arrangement is the same as just now, with this difference,
that the point of support is at a short distance from the animal hung
up.</p>

<p>My trick, simple though it be, is quite successful. For a long time
the body is repeatedly shaken, but in vain; the tibiæ, the hard claws
refuse to yield to the patient saw. Sparrows and Mice grow dry and
shrivel, unused, upon the gallows. My Necrophori, <a name="page344"></a>some sooner, some
later, abandon the insoluble mechanical problem: to push, ever so
little, the movable support and so to unhook the coveted carcase.</p>

<p>Curious reasoners, in faith! If, just now, they had a lucid idea of
the mutual relations between the tied legs and the suspending peg; if
they made the Mouse fall by a reasoned manoeuvre, whence comes it
that the present artifice, no less simple than the first, is to them
an insurmountable obstacle? For days and days they work on the body,
examining it from head to foot, without noticing the movable support,
the cause of their mishap. In vain I prolong my watch; I never see a
single one of them push the support with his foot or butt it with his
head.</p>

<p>Their defeat is not due to lack of strength. Like the Geotrupes, they
are vigorous excavators. When you grasp them firmly in your hand,
they slip into the interstices of the fingers and plough up your skin
so as to make you quickly loose your hold. With his head, a powerful
ploughshare, the Beetle might very easily push the ring off its short
support. He is not able to do so, because he does not think of it; he
does not think of it, because he is devoid of the faculty attributed
to him, in order to support <a name="page345"></a>their theories, by the dangerous
generosity of the evolutionists.</p>

<p>Divine reason, sun of the intellect, what a clumsy slap in thy august
countenance, when the glorifiers of the animal degrade thee with such
denseness!</p>

<p>Let us now examine the mental obscurity of the Necrophori under
another aspect. My captives are not so satisfied with their sumptuous
lodging that they do not seek to escape, especially when there is a
dearth of labour, that sovran consoler of the afflicted, man or
beast. Internment within the wire cover palls upon them. So, when the
Mole is buried and everything in order in the cellar, they stray
uneasily over the trellised dome; they clamber up, come down, go up
again and take to flight, a flight which instantly becomes a fall,
owing to collision with the wire grating. They pick themselves up and
begin all over again. The sky is splendid; the weather is hot, calm
and propitious for those in search of the Lizard crushed beside the
footpath. Perhaps the effluvia of the gamy tit-bit have reached them
from afar, imperceptible to any other sense than that of the
grave-diggers. My Necrophori therefore would be glad to get away.</p>

<p>Can they? Nothing would be easier, if <a name="page346"></a>a glimmer of reason were to aid
them. Through the trelliswork, over which they have so often strayed,
they have seen, outside, the free soil, the promised land which they
want to reach. A hundred times if once have they dug at the foot of
the rampart. There, in vertical wells, they take up their station,
drowsing whole days on end while unemployed. If I give them a fresh
Mole, they emerge from their retreat by the entrance-corridor and
come to hide themselves beneath the belly of the beast. The burial
over, they return, one here, one there, to the confines of the
enclosure and disappear underground.</p>

<p>Well, in two and a half months of captivity, despite long stays at
the base of the trellis, at a depth of three-quarters of an inch
beneath the surface, it is rare indeed for a Necrophorus to succeed
in circumventing the obstacle, in prolonging his excavation beneath
the barrier, in digging an elbow and bringing it out on the other
side, a trifling task for these vigorous creatures. Of fourteen only
one succeeds in escaping.</p>

<p>A chance deliverance and not premeditated; for, if the happy event
had been the result of a mental combination, the other prisoners,
practically his equals in powers <a name="page347"></a>of perception, would all, from first
to last, have discovered by rational means the elbowed path leading
to the outer world; and the cage would promptly be deserted. The
failure of the great majority proves that the single fugitive was
simply digging at random. Circumstances favoured him; and that is
all. We must not put it to his credit that he succeeded where all the
others failed.</p>

<p>We must also beware of attributing to the Necrophori a duller
understanding than is usual in insect psychology. I find the
ineptness of the undertaker in all the Beetles reared under the wire
cover, on the bed of sand into which the rim of the dome sinks a
little way. With very rare exceptions, fortuitous accidents, not one
thinks of circumventing the barrier by way of the base; not one
manages to get outside by means of a slanting tunnel, not even though
he be a miner by profession, as are the Dung-beetles <i>par
excellence</i>. Captives under the wire dome and anxious to escape,
Sacred Beetles, Geotrupes, Copres, Gymnopleuri,<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small>
Sisyphi,<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> all
see about them the free space, the joys of the open sunlight; and not
one thinks <a name="page348"></a>of going round under the rampart, which would present no
difficulty to their pickaxes.</p>

<p>Even in the higher ranks of animality, examples of similar mental
obfuscation are not lacking. Audubon<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small> tells us how, in his days,
wild Turkeys were caught in North America. In a clearing known to be
frequented by these birds, a great cage was constructed with stakes
driven into the ground. In the centre of the enclosure opened a short
tunnel, which dipped under the palisade and returned to the surface
outside the cage by a gentle slope, which was open to the sky. The
central opening, wide enough to give a bird free passage, occupied
only a portion of the enclosure, leaving around it, against the
circle of stakes, a wide unbroken zone. A few handfuls of maize were
scattered in the interior of the trap, as well as round about it, and
in particular along the sloping path, which passed under a sort of
bridge and led to the centre of the contrivance. In short, the
Turkey-trap presented an ever-open door. The bird found it in order
to enter, <a name="page349"></a>but did not think of looking for it in order to go out.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> John James Audubon (1780-1851), the noted American
ornithologist, of French descent, author of <i>Birds of America</i>
(1827-1830) and <i>Ornithological Biography</i>
(1831-1839).&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>According to the famous American ornithologist, the Turkeys, lured by
the grains of maize, descended the insidious slope, entered the short
underground passage and beheld, at the end of it, plunder and the
light. A few steps farther and the gluttons emerged, one by one, from
beneath the bridge. They distributed themselves about the enclosure.
The maize was abundant; and the Turkeys' crops grew swollen.</p>

<p>When all was gathered, the band wished to retreat, but not one of the
prisoners paid any attention to the central hole by which he had
arrived. Gobbling uneasily, they passed again and again across the
bridge whose arch was yawning beside them; they circled round against
the palisade, treading a hundred times in their own footprints; they
thrust their necks, with their crimson wattles, through the bars; and
there, with their beaks in the open air, they fought and struggled
until they were exhausted.</p>

<p>Remember, O inept one, what happened but a little while ago; think of
the tunnel that led you hither! If that poor brain of yours contains
an atom of ability, put two ideas together and remind yourself that
the <a name="page350"></a>passage by which you entered is there and open for your escape!
You will do nothing of the kind. The light, an irresistible
attraction, holds you subjugated against the palisade; and the shadow
of the yawning pit, which has but lately permitted you to enter and
will quite as readily permit you to go out, leaves you indifferent.
To recognize the use of this opening you would have to reflect a
little, to recall the past; but this tiny retrospective calculation
is beyond your powers. So the trapper, returning a few days later,
will find a rich booty, the entire flock imprisoned!</p>

<p>Of poor intellectual repute, does the Turkey deserve his name for
stupidity? He does not appear to be more limited than another.
Audubon depicts him as endowed with certain useful ruses, in
particular when he has to baffle the attacks of his nocturnal enemy,
the Virginian Owl. As for his behaviour in the snare with the
underground passage, any other bird, impassioned of the light, would
do the same.</p>

<p>Under rather more difficult conditions, the Necrophorus repeats the
ineptness of the Turkey. When he wishes to return to the daylight,
after resting in a short burrow against the rim of the cover, the
Beetle, <a name="page351"></a>seeing a little light filtering through the loose soil,
reascends the entrance-well, incapable of telling himself that he has
only to prolong the tunnel as far in the opposite direction to reach
the outer world beyond the wall and gain his freedom. Here again is
one in whom we shall seek in vain for any sign of reflection. Like
the rest, in spite of his legendary renown, he has no guide but the
unconscious promptings of instinct.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<center>THE GIANT SCARITES</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>The military profession can hardly be said to favour the talents.
Consider the Carabus, or Ground-beetle, that fiery warrior among the
insect people. What can he do? In the way of industry, nothing or
next to nothing. Nevertheless the dull butcher is magnificent in his
indescribably sumptuous jerkin. It has the refulgency of copper
pyrites, of gold, of Florentine bronze. While clad in black, he
enriches his sombre costume with a vivid amethyst hem. On the
wing-cases, which fit him like a cuirass, he wears little chains of
alternate pins and bosses.</p>

<p>Of a handsome and commanding figure, slender and pinched in at the
waist, the Carabus is the glory of our collections, but only for the
sake of his appearance. He is a frenzied murderer; and that is all.
We will ask nothing more of him. The wisdom of antiquity represented
Hercules, the god of strength, with the head of an idiot. And indeed
merit is not great when limited to brute force. And this is the case
with the Carabus.</p>
<a name="page353"></a>
<p>To see him so richly adorned, who would not wish to find him a fine
subject for investigation, one worthy of history, a subject such as
humbler natures provide with lavish generosity? From this ferocious
ransacker of entrails we expect nothing of the kind. His art is that
of slaying.</p>

<p>We may without trouble observe him at his bandit's work. I rear him
in a large breeding-cage on a layer of fresh sand. A few potsherds
scattered about the surface enable him to take shelter beneath the
rocks; a tuft of grass planted in the centre makes a grove and
enlivens the establishment.</p>

<p>Three species compose the population: the common <i>Jardinière</i>, or
Golden Beetle, the usual inmate of our gardens; <i>Procrustes
coriaceus</i>, the sombre and powerful explorer of the grassy thickets
at the foot of walls; and the rare Purple Carabus, who trims the
ebony of his wing-cases with metallic violet. I feed them on Snails,
after partly removing the shell.</p>

<p>Hidden at first promiscuously under the potsherds, the Carabi make a
rush for the wretched Snail, who, in his despair, alternately puts
out and withdraws his horns. Three of them at a time, then four, then
five begin by devouring the edge of his mantle, <a name="page354"></a>specked with chalky
atoms. This is the favourite morsel. With their mandibles, those
stout pincers, they lay hold of it through the froth; they tug at it,
tear off a shred and retire to a distance to swallow it at their
ease.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the legs, streaming with slime, pick up grains of sand and
become covered with heavy gaiters, which are extremely cumbersome but
to which the Beetle pays no attention. Heavy with mire, he staggers
back to his prey and cuts off another morsel. He will think of
polishing his boots presently. Others do not stir, but gorge
themselves on the spot, with the whole fore-part of their body
immersed in the froth. The feast lasts for hours on end. The guests
do not leave the joint until the distended belly lifts the roof of
the wing-cases and uncovers the nudities of the stern.</p>

<p>Fonder of shady nooks, the Procrustes form a separate company. They
drag the Snail into their lair, under the shelter of a potsherd, and
there, peacefully and in common, dismember the mollusc. They love the
Slug, as easier to cut up than the Snail, who is defended by his
shell; they regard the Testacella,<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> who bears a chalky shell,
shaped like <a name="page355"></a>a Phrygian cap, right at the hinder end of her foot, as a
delicious tit-bit. The game has firmer flesh and is less nauseously
slimy.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Or Shell-bearing Slug, found along the shores of the
Mediterranean.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>To feast gluttonously on a Snail whom I myself have rendered
defenseless by breaking her shell is nothing for a warrior to boast
about; but we shall soon see the Carabus display his daring. I offer
a Pine-chafer, in the pink of strength, to the Golden Beetle, whose
appetite has been whetted by a few days' fasting. The victim is a
colossus beside the Golden Carabus; an Ox facing a Wolf.</p>

<p>The beast of prey prowls round the peaceful creature and selects its
moment. It rushes forward, recoils, hesitates and returns to the
charge. And lo, the giant is overthrown! Incontinently the other
devours him, ransacking his belly. If this had happened in a higher
order of the animal world, it would make one's flesh creep to watch
the Carabus half immersed in the big Cockchafer and rooting out his
entrails.</p>

<p>I test the eviscerator with a more difficult quarry. This time the
victim is <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>, the powerful Rhinoceros Beetle, an
invincible giant, one would think, under the shelter of his armour.
But the hunter knows the weak point of the horn-clad prey, <a name="page356"></a>the fine
skin protected by the wing-cases. By means of attacks which the
assailant renews as soon as they are repulsed by the assailed, the
Carabus contrives to raise the cuirass slightly and to slip his head
beneath it. From the moment that the pincers have made a gash in the
vulnerable skin, the Rhinoceros is lost. Soon there will be nothing
left of the colossus but a pitiful empty carcase.</p>

<p>Those who wish for a more hideous conflict must apply to <i>Calosoma
sycophanta</i>, the handsomest of our flesh-eating insects, the most
majestic in costume and size. This prince of Carabi is the butcher of
the caterpillars. He is not to be overawed even by the sturdiest of
rumps.</p>

<p>His struggle with the huge caterpillar of the Great Peacock Moth<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small>
is a thing to see once, not oftener: a single experience of such
horrors is enough to disgust one. The contortions of the eviscerated
insect, which, with a sudden heave of the loins, hurls the bandit in
the air and lets him fall, belly uppermost, without managing to make
him release his hold; the green entrails spilt quivering on the
<a name="page357"></a>ground; the tramping gait of the murderer, drunk with slaughter,
slaking his thirst at the springs of a horrible wound: these are the
main features of the combat. If entomology had no other scenes to
show us, I should without the least regret turn my back upon my
insects.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Life of the Caterpillar:</i> chap.
xi.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Next day, offer the sated Beetle a Green Grasshopper or a White-faced
Decticus, serious adversaries both, armed with powerful lower jaws.
With these big-bellied creatures the slaughter will begin anew, as
eagerly as on the day before. It will be repeated later with the
Pine-chafer and the Rhinoceros Beetle, accompanied by the usual
atrocious tactics of the Carabi. Even better than these last does the
Calosoma know the weak point of the armoured Beetles, concealed
beneath the wing-cases. And this will go on so long as we keep him
provided with victims, for this drinker of blood is never satiated.</p>

<p>Acrid exhalations, the products of a fiery temperament, accompany
this frenzy for carnage. The Carabi elaborate caustic humours; the
Procrustes squirts a jet of vinegar at any one who takes hold of him;
the Calosoma makes the fingers smell of <a name="page358"></a>mouldy drugs; certain
Beetles, such as the Brachini,<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> understand explosives and singe the
aggressor's whiskers with a volley of musketry.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> Or Bombardier Beetles. When disturbed, they eject a
fluid which volatilizes, on contact with the air, with a slight
report.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>Distillers of corrosives, gunners throwing lyddite, bombers employing
dynamite: what can all these violent creatures, so well equipped for
battle, do beyond committing slaughter? Nothing. We find no art, no
industry, not even in the larva, which practices the adult's trade
and meditates its crimes while wandering under the stones.
Nevertheless it is to one of these dull-witted warriors that I am
deliberately proposing to apply to-day, prompted by the wish to solve
a certain question. Let me tell you what it is.</p>

<p>You have surprised this or that insect, motionless on a bough,
blissfully basking in the sun. Your hand is raised, open, ready to
descend on it and seize it. Hardly have you made the movement when
the insect drops to the ground. It is a wearer of armoured
wing-cases, slow to disengage the wings from their horny sheath, or
perhaps an incomplete form, with no wing-surfaces. <a name="page359"></a>Incapable of
sudden flight, the surprised insect lets itself fall. You look for it
in the grass, often in vain. If you do find it, it is lying on its
back, with its legs folded, without stirring.</p>

<p>It is shamming dead, people will tell you; it is pretending, in order
to escape its enemy. Man is certainly unknown to it; we count for
nothing in its little world. What does it care for our hunting,
whether we be children or scientists? It does not fear the collector
with his long pin; but it realizes danger in general; and it dreads
its natural enemy, the insectivorous bird, which swallows it with a
single snap. To outwit the assailant, it lies upon its back, draws up
its legs and simulates death. The bird, or any other persecutor, will
despise it in this condition; and its life will be saved.</p>

<p>This, we are assured, is how the insect would reason if suddenly
surprised. The trick has long been famous. Once upon a time, two
friends, at the end of their resources, sold the skin of a Bear
before they had killed the brute. The encounter was unfortunate: they
had to take to their heels. One of them stumbled, fell, held his
breath and shammed dead. The Bear came up, turned the man over and
over, explored him <a name="page360"></a>with his paw and his muzzle, sniffed at his face:</p>

<p>"He smells already," he said and, without more ado, turned away.</p>

<p>That Bear was a simpleton.</p>

<p>The bird would not be duped by this clumsy stratagem. In those happy
days when the discovery of a nest marked a red-letter day, I never
saw my Sparrows or Greenfinches refuse a Locust because he was not
moving, or a Fly because she was dead. Any mouthful that does not
kick is eagerly accepted, provided that it be fresh and pleasant to
the taste.</p>

<p>If the insect, therefore, relies on the appearance of death, it would
seem to me to be very badly inspired. More wary than the Bear in the
fable, the bird, with its perspicacious eye, will recognize the fraud
in a moment and proceed to business. Besides, had the object really
been a corpse, but still fresh, it would none the less have gobbled
it up.</p>

<p>More insistent doubts occur to my mind when I consider the serious
consequences to which the insect's artfulness might lead. It shams
dead, says the popular idiom, which recks little of weighing the
value of its term; it simulates death, scientific language repeats,
<a name="page361"></a>happy to find some gleams of reason in the insect. What truth is
there in this unanimous statement, which in the one case is too
unreflecting and in the other too much inclined to favour theoretical
fancies?</p>

<p>Logical arguments are insufficient here. It is essential that we
should obtain the verdict of experiment, which alone can furnish a
valid reply. But to which of the insects shall we go first?</p>

<p>I remember something that dates back some forty years. Delighted with
a recent University triumph, I was staying at Cette, on my return
from Toulouse, where I had just passed my examination as a licentiate
in natural science. It gave me a fine chance of renewing my
acquaintance with the seaside flora, which had delighted me a few
years before on the shores of the wonderful Gulf of Ajaccio. It would
have been foolish to neglect it. A degree does not confer the right
to cease studying. If one really has a touch of the sacred fire in
one's veins, one remains a student all one's life, not of books,
which are a poor resource, but of the great, inexhaustible school of
actual things.</p>

<p>One day, then, in July, in the cool stillness of the dawn, I was
botanizing on the foreshore at Cette. For the first time I plucked
<a name="page362"></a>the <i>Convolvulus soldanella</i>, which trails along the high-water mark
its ropes of glossy green leaves and its great pink bellflowers.
Withdrawn into his white, flat, heavily-keeled shell, a curious
Snail, <i>Helix explanata</i>, was slumbering, in groups, on the bent
grasses.</p>

<p>The dry shifting sands showed here and there long series of imprints,
recalling, on a smaller scale and under another form, the tracks of
little birds in the snow which used to arouse a delightful flutter in
my youthful days. What do these imprints mean?</p>

<p>I follow them, a hunter on the trail of a new species. At the end of
each track, by digging to no great depth, I unearth a magnificent
Carabus, whose very name is almost unknown to me. It is the Giant
Scarites (<i>S. gigas</i>, FAB.).</p>

<p>I make him walk on the sand. He exactly reproduces the tracks which
put me on the alert. It was certainly he who, questing for game in
the night, marked the trail with his feet. He returned to his lair
before daylight; and now not a single Beetle is to be seen in the
open.</p>

<p>Another characteristic thrusts itself upon my notice. If I shake him
for a moment and then place him on the ground upon his <a name="page363"></a>back, he
remains a long time without stirring. No other insect has yet
displayed such persistent immobility, though I confess that my
investigations in this respect have been only superficial. The detail
is so thoroughly engraved on my memory that, forty years later, when
I want to experiment on the insects which are experts in the art of
simulating death, I at once think of the Scarites.</p>

<p>A friend sends me a dozen from Cette, from the very beach on which I
once passed a delightful morning in the company of this skilful mimic
of the dead. They reach me in perfect condition, mixed up in the same
package with some Pimeliæ (<i>P. bipunctata</i>, FAB.), their compatriots
in the sands beside the sea. Of these last, a pitiable crew, many
have been disembowelled, absolutely emptied; others have merely
stumps instead of legs; a few, but only a few, are unwounded.</p>

<p>It was what one might have expected of these Carabidæ, lawless
hunters one and all. Tragic events took place in the box during the
journey from Cette to Sérignan. The Scarites gormandized riotously on
the peaceable Pimeliæ.</p>

<p>Their tracks, which I followed long ago on the actual spot, bore
evidence to their nocturnal rounds, apparently in search of <a name="page364"></a>their
prey, the pot-bellied Pimelia, whose sole defence consists of a
strong armour of welded wing-cases.<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small> But what can such a cuirass
avail against the bandit's ruthless pincers?</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> The Pimelia is a wingless Beetle.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>He is indeed a mighty hunter, this Nimrod of the sea-shore. All black
and glossy, like a jet bugle, his body is divided by a very narrow
groove at the waist. His weapon of offence consists of a pair of
claw-like mandibles of extraordinary vigour. None of our insects
equals him in strength of jaw, if we except the Stag-beetle, who is
far better armed, or rather decorated, for the antlered mandibles of
the inmate of the oak are ornaments of the male's attire, not a
panoply of battle.</p>

<p>The brutal Carabid, the eviscerator of the Pimeliæ, knows how strong
he is. If I tease him a little on the table, he at once adopts a
posture of defence. Well braced upon his short legs, especially the
fore-legs, which are toothed like rakes, he dislocates himself in
two, so to speak, thanks to the groove that divides him behind the
corselet; he proudly raises the fore-part of the body, his wide,
heart-shaped thorax and massive head, opening his threatening pincers
to their full extent. He is now an awesome sight. More: he has <a name="page365"></a>the
audacity to rush at the finger which has touched him. Here of a
surety is one not easily intimidated. I look twice before I handle
him.</p>

<p>I lodge my strangers partly under a wire-gauze cover and partly in
glass jars, all supplied with a layer of sand. Each of them without
delay digs himself a burrow. The insect bends his head a long way
down and, with the points of his mandibles, brought together to form
a pick-axe, he hews, digs and excavates with a will. The fore-legs,
spread out and armed with hooks, gather the dust and rubbish into a
load which is thrust backwards. In this way, a mound rises on the
threshold of the burrow. The dwelling grows deeper quickly and by a
gentle slope reaches the bottom of the jar.</p>

<p>Checked in the downward direction, the Scarites now digs against the
glass wall and continues his work horizontally until he has obtained
a length of nearly twelve inches in all.</p>

<p>This arrangement of the gallery, almost the whole of which runs just
under the glass, is very useful to me, enabling me to follow the
insect in the privacy of its home. If I wish to observe its
underground operations, all that I need do is to remove the opaque
<a name="page366"></a>sheath which I have been careful to put over the jar, in order to
spare the creature the annoyance of the light.</p>

<p>When the house is deemed to be long enough, the Scarites returns to
the entrance, which he works more carefully than the rest. He makes a
funnel of it, a pit with shifting, sloping sides. It is the
Ant-lion's crater on a larger scale and constructed in a more rustic
fashion. This mouth is continued by an inclined plane, kept free of
all rubbish. At the foot of the slope is the vestibule of the
horizontal gallery. Here, as a rule, the hunter lurks, motionless,
with his pincers half open. He is waiting.</p>

<p>There is a sound overhead. It is a specimen of game which I have just
introduced, a Cicada, a luscious morsel. The drowsy trapper at once
wakes; he moves his palpi, which quiver with cupidity. Cautiously,
step by step, he climbs his inclined plane. He takes a glance outside
the funnel. The Cicada is seen.</p>

<p>The Scarites darts out of his pit, runs forward, seizes the Cicada
and drags her backwards. The struggle is brief, thanks to the trap of
the entrance, which yawns like a funnel to receive even a bulky
quarry and contracts into a crumbling precipice that <a name="page367"></a>paralyses all
resistance. The slope is fatal: who crosses the brink can no longer
escape the murderer.</p>

<p>Head first, the Cicada dives into the abyss, down which the spoiler
drags her by successive jerks. She is drawn into the low-ceilinged
tunnel. Here the wings cease to flutter, for lack of space. She
reaches the knacker's cellar, at the end of the corridor. The
Scarites now works at her for some time with his pincers, in order to
reduce her to complete immobility, fearing lest she should escape;
then he returns to the mouth of the charnel-house.</p>

<p>It is not everything to possess plenty of game; the question next
arises how to consume it in peace. The door is therefore closed
against importunate callers, that is to say, the insect fills the
entrance to the tunnel with his mound of rubbish. Having taken this
precaution, he goes back again and sits down to his meal. He will not
reopen his hiding-place nor remake the pit at the entrance until
later, when the Cicada has been digested and hunger makes its
reappearance. Let us leave the glutton with his quarry.</p>

<p>The brief morning which I spent with him in his native place did not
enable me to watch him at his hunting, on the sands of the beach; <a name="page368"></a>but
the facts gathered in captivity are enough to tell us all about it.
They show us in the Scarites a bold hero who is not to be intimidated
by the biggest or strongest adversary.</p>

<p>We have seen him coming up from underground, falling on the
passers-by, seizing them at some distance from the burrow and
dragging them forcibly into his cut-throat den. The Rose-chafer, the
Common Cockchafer are but small deer for him. He dares to attack the
Cicada, he dares to dig his hooks into the corpulent Pine-chafer. He
is a fearless ruffian, ready for any crime.</p>

<p>Under natural conditions his audacity can be no less. On the
contrary, the familiar spots, freedom of movement, unlimited space
and his beloved salt air excite the warrior to yet greater feats of
daring.</p>

<p>He has dug himself a refuge in the sand, with a wide, crumbling
mouth. This is not so that he may, like the Ant-lion, wait at the
bottom of his funnel for the passing of a victim which stumbles on
the shifting slope and rolls into the pit. The Scarites disdains
these petty poachers' methods, these fowlers' snares; he prefers a
run across country.</p>

<p>His long trails on the sand tell us of nocturnal rounds in search of
big game, often <a name="page369"></a>the Pimelia, sometimes the Half-spotted Scarab.<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small>
The find is not consumed on the spot. To enjoy it at his ease, he
needs the peaceful darkness of the underground manor; and so the
captive, seized by one leg with the pincers, is forcibly dragged
along the ground.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>5</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Sacred Beetle and Others:</i> chaps. ii. and
vii.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>If no precautions were taken, the introduction of the victim into the
burrow would be impracticable, with a huge quarry offering a
desperate resistance. But the entrance to the tunnel is a wide
crater, with crumbling walls. However large he be, the captive,
tugged from below, enters and tumbles into the pit. The crumbling
rubbish immediately buries him and paralyses his movements. The thing
is done. The bandit now proceeds to close his door and empty his
prey's belly.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<center>THE SIMULATION OF DEATH</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>The first insect that we will put to the question is that audacious
disemboweller, the savage Scarites. To provoke his state of inertia
is a very simple matter: I handle him for a moment, rolling him
between my fingers; better still, I drop him on the table, twice or
thrice in succession, from a small height. When the shock due to the
fall has been administered and, if need be, repeated, I turn the
insect on its back.</p>

<p>This is enough: the prostrate Beetle no longer stirs, lies as though
dead. The legs are folded on the belly, the antennæ extended like the
arms of a cross, the pincers open. A watch beside me tells me the
exact minute of the beginning and the end of the experiment. Nothing
remains but to wait and especially to arm one's self with patience,
for the insect's immobility lasts long enough to become tedious to
the observer watching for something to happen.</p>

<p>The duration of the lifeless posture varies greatly on the same day,
under the same <a name="page371"></a>atmospheric conditions and with the same subject,
though I cannot fathom the causes which shorten or lengthen it. How
to investigate the external influences, so numerous and often so
slight, which intervene in such a case; above all, how to scrutinize
the insect's private impressions: these are impenetrable mysteries.
Let us confine ourselves to recording the results.</p>

<p>Immobility continues fairly often for as long as fifty minutes; in
certain cases, even, it lasts more than an hour. The most frequent
length of time averages twenty minutes. If nothing disturbs the
Beetle, if I cover him with a glass shade, protecting him from the
Flies, who are importunate visitors in the hot weather prevailing at
the time of my experiment, the inertia is complete: not a quiver of
the tarsi, nor of the palpi, nor of the antennæ. Here indeed is a
simulacrum of death, with all its inertia.</p>

<p>At last the apparently deceased comes back to life. The tarsi quiver,
those of the fore-legs first; the palpi and the antennæ move slowly
to and fro: this is the prelude to the awakening. Now the legs begin
to kick. The insect bends slightly at its pinched waist; it
buttresses itself on its head and back; it turns over. There it goes,
jogging away, <a name="page372"></a>ready to become an apparent corpse once more if I renew
my shock tactics.</p>

<p>Let us repeat the experiment immediately. The newly resuscitated
Beetle is for a second time lying motionless on his back. He prolongs
his make-believe of death longer than he did at first. When he wakes
up, I renew the test a third, a fourth, a fifth time, with no
intervals of repose. The duration of the motionless condition
increases each time. To quote the figures, the five consecutive
experiments, from the first to the last, have continued respectively
for 17, 20, 25, 33 and 50 minutes. Starting with a quarter of an
hour, the attitude of death ends by lasting nearly a whole hour.</p>

<p>Without being constant, similar facts recur repeatedly in my
experiments, the duration, of course, varying. They tell us that as a
general rule the Scarites lengthens the period of his lifeless
posture the oftener the experiment is repeated. Is this a matter of
practice, or is it an increase of cunning employed in the hope of
finally tiring a too persistent enemy? It would be premature to draw
conclusions: the cross-examination of the insect has not yet been
thorough enough.</p>

<p>Let us wait. Besides, we need not <a name="page373"></a>imagine that it is possible to go
on like this until our patience is exhausted. Sooner or later,
flurried by my pestering, the Scarites refuses to sham dead. Scarcely
is he laid on his back after a fall, when he turns over and takes to
his heels, as though he judged a stratagem which succeeded so
indifferently to be henceforth useless.</p>

<p>If we were to stop here, it would certainly seem that the insect, a
cunning hoaxer, seeks, as a means of defence, to cheat those who
attack him. He counterfeits death; he repeats the process, becoming
more persistent in his fraud in proportion as the aggression is
repeated; he abandons his trickery when he deems it futile. But
hitherto we have subjected him only to a friendly
examination-in-chief. The time has come to put a string of searching
questions and to trick the trickster if there be really any
deception.</p>

<p>The Beetle under experiment is lying on the table. He feels beneath
him a hard body which gives him no chance of digging. As he cannot
hope to take refuge underground, an easy task for his nimble and
vigorous tools, the Scarites lies low in his death-like pose, keeping
it up, if need be, for an hour. If he were reclining on the sand, the
loose soil with which he is so familiar, would he <a name="page374"></a>not regain his
activity more rapidly, would he not at least betray by a few twitches
his desire to escape into the basement?</p>

<p>I was expecting to see him do so; and I was mistaken. Whether I place
him on wood, glass, sand or garden mould, the Beetle in no way
modifies his tactics. On a surface readily excavated he continues his
immobility as long as on an unassailable surface.</p>

<p>This indifference to the nature of the support half opens the door to
doubt; what follows opens it wide. The patient is on the table before
me and I watch him closely. With his gleaming eyes, overshadowed by
his antennæ, he also sees me; he watches me; he observes me, if I may
so express myself. What can be the visual impression of the insect
when face to face with that monstrosity, man? How does the pigmy
measure the enormous monument that is the human body? Seen from the
depths of the infinitely little, the immense perhaps is nothing.</p>

<p>We will not go so far as that; we will admit that the insect watches
me, recognizes me as his persecutor. So long as I am here, he will
suspect me and refuse to budge. If he does decide to do so, it will
be after he has exhausted my patience. Let us <a name="page375"></a>therefore move away.
Then, since any trickery will be needless, he will hasten to take to
his legs again and make off.</p>

<p>I move ten paces farther from him, to the other end of the room. I
hide, I do not move a muscle, for fear of breaking the silence. Will
the insect pick itself up? No, my precautions are superfluous. Alone,
left to itself, perfectly quiet, it remains motionless for as long a
time as when I was standing close beside it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the clear-sighted Scarites has seen me in my corner, at the
other end of the room; perhaps a subtle scent has revealed my
presence to him. We will do more, then. I cover him with a bell-glass
which will save him from being worried by the Flies and I leave the
room; I go downstairs into the garden. There is no longer anything
likely to disturb him. Doors and windows are closed. Not a sound from
without; no cause for alarm indoors. What will happen in the midst of
that profound silence?</p>

<p>Nothing more and nothing less than usual. After twenty, forty
minutes' waiting out of doors, I come upstairs again and return to my
insect. I find him as I left him, lying motionless on his back.</p>

<p>This experiment, many times repeated with <a name="page376"></a>different subjects, throws
a vivid light upon the question. It expressly assures us that the
attitude of death is not the ruse of an insect in danger. Here there
is nothing to alarm the creature. Around him all is silence,
solitude, repose. When he persists in his immobility it cannot now be
to deceive an enemy. I have no doubt about it: there is something
else involved.</p>

<p>Besides, why should he need special defensive artifices? I could
understand that a weak, pacific, ill-protected insect might resort to
ruses when in danger; but in him, the warlike bandit, so well
armoured, it is more than I can understand. No insect on his native
sea-shore has the strength to resist him. The most powerful of them,
the Sacred Beetle and the Pimelia, are easy-going creatures which, so
far from molesting him, are fine booty for his burrow.</p>

<p>Can he be threatened by the birds? It is very doubtful. As a Carabus,
he is saturated with acrid humours which must make his body a far
from pleasing mouthful. For the rest, he lives hidden from the light
of day in a burrow where no one sees him; he emerges only at night,
when the birds are no longer inspecting the beach. There are no beaks
about for him to fear.</p>
<a name="page377"></a>
<p>And this butcher of the Pimeliæ and even occasionally of the Sacred
Beetles, this bully whom no danger threatens, is supposed to be such
a coward as to sham death on the slightest alarm! I take the liberty
of doubting this more and more.</p>

<p>I am confirmed in my doubts by the Smooth-skinned Scarites (<i>S.
lavigatus</i>, FAB.), a denizen of the same shores. The first insect is
a giant; the second, by comparison, is a dwarf. Otherwise he displays
the same shape, the same jet-black costume, the same armour, the same
habits of brigandage. Well, the Smooth-skinned Scarites, in spite of
his weakness and his smallness, is almost ignorant of the trick of
pretending to be dead. When molested for a moment and then turned on
his back, he at once picks himself up and flees. I can hardly obtain
a few seconds' immobility; once only, daunted by my obstinacy, the
dwarf remains motionless for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>How different from the giant, motionless the moment that he is thrown
upon his back, sometimes picking himself up only after an hour of
inaction! It is the reverse of what ought to happen, if the apparent
death were really a defensive ruse. The giant, confident in his
strength, should disdain this <a name="page378"></a>cowardly posture; the timid dwarf
should be quick to have recourse to it. And it is just the other way
about. What is there behind all this?</p>

<p>Let us try the influence of danger. With what natural enemy shall I
confront the big Scarites, motionless on his back? I know none. Let
us then create a make-believe assailant. The Flies put me on the
track of one.</p>

<p>I have spoken of their importunity during my investigations in the
hot season. If I do not employ a bell-glass or keep an assiduous
watch, rarely does the shrewish Dipteron fail to alight upon my
patient and explore him with her proboscis. We will let her have her
way this time.</p>

<p>Hardly has the Fly grazed this apparent corpse with her legs, when
the Scarites' tarsi quiver as though twitched by a slight electric
shock. If the visitor be merely passing, matters go no farther; but,
if she persist, particularly near the Beetle's mouth, moist with
saliva and disgorged secretions of food, the tormented Scarites
promptly kicks, turns over and makes off.</p>

<p>Perhaps he did not think it opportune to prolong his fraud in the
face of so contemptible an enemy. He resumes his activity <a name="page379"></a>because he
has recognized the absence of danger. Then let us call in another
interloper, one of formidable size and strength. I happen to have
handy a Great Capricorn, with powerful claws and mandibles. That the
long-horned insect is a peaceful creature I am well aware; but the
Scarites does not know it; on the sands of the shore he has never
encountered such a colossus as this, who is capable of impressing
less timid creatures than he. Fear of the unknown will merely
aggravate the situation.</p>

<p>Guided by the tip of my straw, the Capricorn sets his foot upon the
prostrate insect. The Scarites' tarsi begin to quiver immediately. If
the contact be prolonged or multiplied, or if it become aggressive,
the dead insect gets on its legs again and scuttles off, just as the
titillations of the Fly have already shown me. When danger is
imminent and all the more to be dreaded because its nature is
unknown, the trick of the simulation of death disappears and flight
takes its place.</p>

<p>The following experiment is not without value. I take some hard
substance and knock the foot of the table on which the insect is
lying on its back. The shock is very slight, not enough to shake the
table <a name="page380"></a>perceptibly. The whole thing is limited to the inner vibrations
of a resilient body which has received a blow. But it is quite enough
to disturb the insect's immobility. At each tap the tarsi are flexed
and quiver for a moment.</p>

<p>Lastly, let us try the effect of light. So far, the patient has been
treated in the shade of my cabinet, away from the direct sunlight.
The sun is shining full upon the window. What will the motionless
insect do if I carry it thither, from my table to the window, into
the bright light? That we can find out in a moment. Under the direct
rays of the sun, the Scarites immediately turns over and moves off.</p>

<p>This is enough. Patient, persecuted creature, you have half-betrayed
your insect. When the Fly tickles you, drains your moist lip, treats
you as a corpse whose juices she would like to suck; when the huge
Capricorn appears to your horrified gaze and puts a foot on your
belly, as though to take possession of his prey; when the table
quivers, that is to say, when, for you, the ground shakes, undermined
perhaps by some invader of your burrow; when a bright light surrounds
you, favouring the designs of your enemies and imperilling your
safety as an insect that loves the dark, then, in truth, it would be
wiser <a name="page381"></a>not to move, if really your chief resource, when danger
threatens you, is to simulate death.</p>

<p>On the contrary, at those critical moments, you give a start; you
move, you resume your normal attitude, you run away. Your fraud is
discovered; or, to put it more plainly, there is no trick. Your
inertia is not simulated; it is real. It is a condition of temporary
torpor into which you are plunged by your delicate nervous
organization. A mere nothing makes you fall into it; a mere nothing
withdraws you from it, above all a bath of light, that sovran
stimulus of activity.</p>

<p>In respect of prolonged immobility as the result of emotion, I find a
rival of the Giant Scarites in a large black Buprestis, with a
flour-speckled corselet, a lover of the blackthorn, the hawthorn and
the apricot-tree. His name is <i>Capnodis tenebrionis</i>, LIN. At times I
see him, with his legs closely folded and his antennæ lowered,
prolonging his motionless posture upon his back for more than an
hour. At other times the insect is bent upon escaping, apparently
influenced by atmospheric conditions of which I do not know the
secret. One or two minutes' immobility is as much as I can then
obtain.</p>

<p>Let me recapitulate: in my various <a name="page382"></a>subjects the attitude of death is
of very variable duration, governed as it is by a host of unsuspected
circumstances. Let us take advantage of favourable opportunities,
which are fairly frequent. I subject the Cloudy Buprestis to the
different tests undergone by the Giant Scarites. The results are the
same. When you have seen the first, you have seen the second. There
is no need to linger over them.</p>

<p>I will only mention the promptness with which the Buprestis, lying
motionless in the shade, recovers his activity when I carry him away
from my table into the broad sunlight of the window. After a few
seconds of this bath of heat and light, the insect half-opens his
wing-cases, using them as levers, and turns over, ready to take
flight if my hand did not instantly snap him up. He is a passionate
lover of the light, a devotee of the sun, intoxicating himself in its
rays upon the bark of his blackthorn-trees on the hottest afternoons.</p>

<p>This love of tropical temperature suggests the following question:
what would happen if I were to chill the creature in its immobile
posture? I foresee a more prolonged inertia. The chill, of course,
must not be great, for it would be followed by the <a name="page383"></a>lethargy into
which insects capable of surviving the winter fall when benumbed by
the cold.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Buprestis must as far as possible retain his
full vitality. The lowering of the temperature must be gentle, very
moderate and such that the insect, under similar climatic conditions,
would retain his powers of action in ordinary life. I have a
convenient refrigerator at my disposal. It is the water of my well,
whose temperature, in summer, is nearly twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit
below that of the surrounding air.</p>

<p>The Buprestis, in whom I have just produced inertia by means of a few
taps, is installed on his back in a little flask which I seal
hermetically and immerse in a bucket full of this cold water. To keep
the bath as cool as at first, I gradually renew it, taking care not
to shake the flask in which the patient is lying, in his attitude of
death.</p>

<p>The result rewards my pains. After five hours under water, the insect
is still motionless. Five hours, I say, five long hours; and I might
certainly say longer, if my exhausted patience had not put an end to
the experiment. But this is enough to banish any idea of fraud on the
insect's part. Here, beyond a doubt, the insect is not shamming dead.
<a name="page384"></a>He is actually somnolent, deprived of the power of movement by an
internal disturbance which my teasing produced at the outset and
which is prolonged beyond its usual limits by the surrounding
coolness.</p>

<p>I try the effect of a slight decrease in temperature upon the Giant
Scarites by subjecting him to a similar sojourn in the cold water of
the well. The result does not respond to the hopes which the
Buprestis gave me. I do not succeed in obtaining more than fifty
minutes' inertia. I have often obtained as long periods of immobility
without resorting to the refrigerating artifice.</p>

<p>It might have been foreseen. The Buprestis, a lover of the burning
sunshine, is affected by the cold bath in a different degree from the
Scarites, who prowls about by night and spends his day in the
basement. A fall of a few degrees in temperature takes the chilly
insect by surprise and has no effect upon the one accustomed to the
coolness underground.</p>

<p>Other experiments on these lines tell me nothing more. I see the
inert condition persisting sometimes for a longer, sometimes for a
shorter period, according as the insect seeks the sunlight or avoids
it. Let us change our method.</p>
<a name="page385"></a>
<p>I evaporate a few drops of sulphuric ether in a glass jar and put in
a Stercoraceous Geotrupes and a specimen of <i>Buprestis tenebrionis</i>,
at the same time. In a few moments both subjects are motionless,
anæsthetized by the etheric vapour. I take them out quickly and lay
them on their backs in the open air.</p>

<p>Their attitude is exactly that which they would have assumed under
the influence of a shock or any other cause of alarm. The Buprestis
has his legs symmetrically folded against his chest and belly; the
Geotrupes has his outspread, stretched in disorder, rigid and as
though attacked by catalepsy. You could not tell if they were dead or
alive.</p>

<p>They are not dead. In a minute or two, the Geotrupes' tarsi twitch,
the palpi quiver, the antennæ wave gently to and fro. Then the
fore-legs move; and a quarter of an hour has not elapsed before the
other legs are struggling. The activity of the insect made motionless
by the concussion of a shock would reawaken in precisely the same
fashion.</p>

<p>As for the Buprestis, he is in a state of inertia so profound that at
first I really believe him to be dead. He recovers during the night;
and next day I find him in possession of his usual activity. The
ether <a name="page386"></a>experiment, which I took care to stop at the moment when it
produced the desired effect, has not been fatal to him; but it has
had much more serious consequences for him than for the Geotrupes.
The insect more sensitive to the alarm due to concussion or to a fall
of temperature is also the more sensitive to the action of ether.</p>

<p>Thus the enormous difference which I observe in these two insects,
with regard to the inertia provoked by a shock or by handling them in
one's fingers, is explained by nice differences of impressionability.
Whereas the Buprestis remains motionless for nearly an hour, the
Geotrupes is struggling violently after a minute or two. And even
then I rarely attain this limit.</p>

<p>In what respect has the Geotrupes, to defend itself, less need of the
stratagem of simulated death than the Black Buprestis, well protected
by his massive build and his armour, which is so hard that it resists
the point of a pin and even of a needle? We should be perplexed by
the same question in respect of a multitude of insects, some of which
remain motionless while others do not; and we could not possibly
foresee what would happen from the genus of the subject, its form, or
its way of living.</p>
<a name="page387"></a>
<p><i>Buprestis tenebrionis</i>, for example, exhibits a persistent inertia.
Will it be the same, because of similarity of structure, with other
members of the same group? Not at all. My chance finds provide me
with the Brilliant Buprestis (<i>B. rutilans</i>, FAB.), and the
Nine-spotted Buprestis (<i>Ptosima novemmaculata</i>, FAB.). The first
resists all my attempts. The splendid creature grips my fingers,
grips my tweezers and insists on getting up the moment that I lay it
on its back. The second readily becomes immobile; but how brief is
its attitude of death! Four or five minutes at most.</p>

<p>A Melasoma-beetle, <i>Omocrates abbreviatus</i>, OLIV., whom I frequently
discover under the broken stones on the neighbouring hills, continues
motionless for over an hour. He rivals the Scarites. We must not
forget to add that very often the awakening takes place within a few
minutes.</p>

<p>Can he owe his long period of inertia to the fact that he is one of
the Tenebrionidæ, or Darkling Beetles? By no means, for here in the
same group is <i>Pimelia bipunctata</i>, who turns a somersault on his
round back and finds his feet the moment he has turned over; here is
a Cellar-beetle (<i>Blaps similis</i>, LATR.), who, unable to turn with
his flat <a name="page388"></a>back, his big belly and his welded wing-cases,<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> struggles
desperately after a minute or two of inertia.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> The Cellar-beetle is one of the wingless
Beetles.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The short-legged Beetles, trotting along with tiny steps, ought, one
would think, to make up in cunning, more fully than the others, for
their incapacity for rapid flight. The facts do not correspond with
this apparently well-founded forecast. I have consulted the genera
Chrysomela,<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small>
Blatta,<small><small><sup>3</sup></small></small> Silpha,
Cleonus,<small><small><sup>4</sup></small></small>
Bolboceras,<small><small><sup>5</sup></small></small> Cetonia,
Hoplia, Coccinella,<small><small><sup>6</sup></small></small> and so on.
A few minutes or a few seconds are
nearly always long enough for the return to activity. Several of them
even obstinately refuse to sham death.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> Golden-apple Beetles.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>3</sup></small> Blackbeetles or Cockroaches.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>4</sup></small> A genus of Weevils.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

chap. xviii.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>6</sup></small> Ladybirds.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>As much must be said of the Beetles well-equipped for pedestrian
escape. Some remain motionless for a few seconds; others, more
numerous still, behave in an ungovernable fashion. In short, there is
no guide to tell us in advance:</p>

<p>"This one will readily assume the posture <a name="page389"></a>of a dead insect; this one
will hesitate; that one will refuse."</p>

<p>There is nothing but shadowy probabilities, until experiment has
given its verdict. From this muddle shall we draw a conclusion which
will set our minds at rest? I hope so.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<center>SUICIDE OR HYPNOSIS?</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>You do not imitate the unfamiliar; you do not counterfeit a thing of
which you know nothing: that is obvious. The simulation of death,
therefore, implies a certain knowledge of death.</p>

<p>Well, has the insect, or rather, has any kind of animal, a
presentiment that its life cannot last for ever? Does the perturbing
problem of an end occur to its dense brain? I have associated a great
deal with animals, I have lived on intimate terms with them and I
have never observed anything to justify me in saying yes. The animal,
with its humbler destiny, is spared that apprehension of the hour of
death which constitutes at once our torment and our greatness.</p>

<p>Like the child still in the limbo of unconsciousness, it enjoys the
present without taking thought of the future; free from the
bitterness of a prospective ending, it lives in the blissful calm of
ignorance. It is ours alone to foresee the briefness of our days; it
is ours <a name="page391"></a>alone anxiously to question the grave regarding the last
sleep.</p>

<p>Moreover, this glimpse of the inevitable destruction calls for a
certain maturity of mind and, for that reason, is rather late in
developing. I had a touching example of it this very week.</p>

<p>A pretty little Kitten, the joy of all the household, after languidly
dragging itself about for a couple of days, died in the night. Next
morning the children found it lying stark in its basket. General
affliction. Anna, especially, a little girl of four, considered with
a pensive glance the little friend with which she had so often
played. She petted it, called it, offered it a drop of milk in a cup:</p>

<p>"Kitty won't play," said the child. "She doesn't want my breakfast
any more. She's asleep. I've never seen her sleep like this before.
When will she wake up?"</p>

<p>This simplicity in the presence of death's harsh problem wrung my
heart. Hastily I led the girl away from the sight and had the dead
Kitten secretly buried. As, from this time onward, it no longer
appeared by the table at meal-times, the grief-stricken child at last
understood that she had seen her little friend sleeping the profound
slumber that <a name="page392"></a>knows no awaking. For the first time a vague idea of
death found its way into her mind.</p>

<p>Has the insect the signal honour of knowing what we do not know in
our early childhood, at a time when thought is already manifesting
itself, far superior, however feeble it be, to the dull understanding
of the animal? Has it the power to foresee an ending, an attribute
which in its case would be inconvenient and useless? Before deciding,
let us consult, not the abstruse theories of science, a doubtful
guide, but the Turkey, an eminently truthful one.</p>

<p>I recall one of the most vivid memories that remain to me from my
brief sojourn at the Royal College of Rodez. So they called it then;
to-day they call it a grammar-school; what improvement as the world
grows older!</p>

<p>The thrice-blessed Thursday had come; our bit of translation was
done, our dozen Greek roots had been learnt by heart; and we trooped
down to the far end of the valley, so many bands of madcaps. With our
trousers turned up to our knees, we exploited, artless fishermen that
we were, the peaceful waters of the river, the Aveyron. What we hoped
to catch was the Loach, no bigger than <a name="page393"></a>our little finger, but
tempting, thanks to his immobility on the sand amid the waterweeds.
We fully expected to transfix him with our trident, a fork.</p>

<p>This miraculous catch, the object of such shouts of triumph when it
succeeded, was very rarely vouchsafed to us: the Loach, the rascal,
saw the fork coming and with three strokes of his tail disappeared!</p>

<p>We found compensation in the apple-trees in the neighbouring
pastures. The apple has from all time been the urchin's delight,
above all when plucked from a tree which does not belong to him. Our
pockets were soon crammed with the forbidden fruit.</p>

<p>Another distraction awaited us. Flocks of Turkeys were not rare,
roaming at their own sweet will and gobbling up the Locusts around
the farms. If no watcher hove in sight, we had great sport. Each of
us would seize a Turkey, tuck her head under her wing, rock it in
this attitude for a moment and then place her on the ground, lying on
her side. The bird no longer budged. The whole flock of Turkeys was
subjected to our hypnotic handling; and the meadow assumed the aspect
of a battle-field strewn with the dead and dying.</p>

<p>And now look out for the farmer's wife! <a name="page394"></a>The loud gobbling of the
harassed birds had told her of our wicked pranks. She would run up
armed with a whip. But we had good legs in those days! And we had a
good laugh too, behind the hedges, which favoured our retreat!</p>

<p>O delightful days when we put the Turkeys to sleep, can I recover the
skill which I then possessed? To-day it is no longer the playful
trick of a schoolboy; it is a matter of serious research. I happen to
have the very subject that I need: a Turkey-hen, doomed soon to be
the victim of our Christmas merry-making. I repeat with her the
method of manipulation which I employed so successfully on the banks
of the Aveyron. I tuck her head well under her wing and, molding it
in this attitude with both hands, I rock the bird gently up and down
for a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>The strange effect is produced; my childhood's manoeuvres obtained no
better result. Laid on the ground, on her side and left to herself,
my patient is a lifeless bundle. One would think her dead, if a
slight rise and fall of the plumage did not reveal the breathing. She
looks really like a dead bird which, in a last convulsion, had drawn
its chilled feet, with their shrivelled toes, under its belly. <a name="page395"></a>The
spectacle has a tragic air; and I feel overcome by a certain anxiety
when I gaze upon the results of my evil spells. Poor Turkey! What if
she were never to wake again!</p>

<p>We need not be afraid: she is waking; she stands up, staggering a
little, it is true, with drooping tail and a shamefaced expression.
That soon passes off; not a trace of it remains. In a few moments the
bird is once more what it was before the experiment.</p>

<p>This torpor, the mean between true sleep and death, is of variable
duration. When repeatedly provoked in my Turkey-hen, with suitable
intervals of repose, immobility lasts sometimes for half an hour and
sometimes for a few minutes. Here, as in the insect, it would be very
difficult to analyse the causes of these differences. With the
Guinea-fowl I succeed even better. The torpor lasts so long that I
become alarmed by the bird's condition. The plumage reveals no trace
of breathing. I ask myself, anxiously, whether the bird is not
actually dead. I push it a little way along the ground with my foot.
The patient does not stir. I do it again. And lo, the Guinea-fowl
frees her head, stands up, regains her balance and scurries <a name="page396"></a>off! Her
state of lethargy has lasted more than half an hour.</p>

<p>Now for the Goose. I have none. The gardener next door trusts me with
his. She is brought to my house, which she fills with her trumpeting
as she waddles about. Shortly afterwards there is absolute silence:
the web-footed Amazon is lying on the ground, with her head tucked
under her wing. Her immobility is as profound and as prolonged as
that of the Turkey and the Guinea-fowl.</p>

<p>It is the Hen's turn now and the Duck's. They too succumb, but, so it
seems to me, less persistently. Can it be that my hypnotic tricks are
less efficacious with small birds than with large ones? To judge by
the Pigeon, this may well be so. He yields to my art only to the
extent of two minutes' sleep. A still smaller bird, a Greenfinch, is
even more refractory: all that I obtain from him is a few seconds'
drowsiness.</p>

<p>It would appear, then, that, in proportion as the activity is
concentrated in a body of less volume, the torpor has less hold. The
insect has already shown us this. The Giant Scarites does not stir
for an hour, while the Smooth-skinned Scarites, a pigmy, wearies my
persistence in turning him over; the large <a name="page397"></a>Cloudy Buprestis submits
to my manoeuvres for a long period, whereas the Glittering Buprestis,
a pigmy again, obstinately refuses to do so.</p>

<p>We will leave on one side, as insufficiently investigated, the
influence of the bodily mass and remember only this fact, that it is
possible, by a very simple artifice, to reduce a bird to a condition
of apparent death. Do my Goose, my Turkey and the others resort to
trickery with the object of deceiving their tormentor? It is certain
that none of them thinks of shamming dead; they are actually immersed
in a deep torpor; in a word, they are hypnotized.</p>

<p>These facts have long been known; they are perhaps the first in date
in the science of hypnosis or artificial sleep. How did we, the
little Rodez schoolboys, learn the secret of the Turkey's slumber? It
was certainly not in our books. Coming from no one knows where,
indestructible as everything that enters into children's games, it
was handed down, from time immemorial, from one initiate to another.</p>

<p>Things are just the same to-day in my village of Sérignan, where
there are numbers of youthful adepts in the art of putting poultry to
sleep. Science often has very humble <a name="page398"></a>beginnings. There is nothing to
tell us that the mischief of a pack of idle urchins is not the
starting-point of our knowledge of hypnosis.</p>

<p>I have just been practising on insects tricks which to all
appearances are as puerile as those which we practised on the Turkeys
in the days when the farmer's wife used to run after us cracking her
whip. Do not laugh: a serious problem looms behind this artlessness.</p>

<p>My insects' condition bears a strange resemblance to that of my
poultry. Both present the image of death, inertia, the contraction of
convulsed limbs. In both again the immobility is dispelled before its
time by the agency of a stimulus, by sound in the case of the bird,
by light in that of the insect. Silence, darkness and tranquillity
prolong it. Its duration varies greatly in different species and
appears to increase with corpulence.</p>

<p>Among ourselves, who are very unequal subjects for induced sleep, the
hypnotist is obliged to pick and choose. He succeeds with one and not
with another. Similarly, among the insects, a selection is necessary,
for they do not all of them, by a long way, respond to the
experimenter's attempts. My best subjects have been the Giant
Scarites and <a name="page399"></a>the Cloudy Buprestis; but how many others have resisted
quite indomitably, or remained motionless for only a few seconds!</p>

<p>The insect's return to the active state presents certain
peculiarities which are well worthy of attention. The key to the
problem lies here. Let us return for a moment to the patients who
have been subjected to the ordeal of ether. These are really
hypnotized. They do not remain motionless by way of a ruse, there is
no doubt upon that point; they are actually on the threshold of
death; and, if I did not take them in good time out of the flask in
which a few drops of ether have been evaporated, they would never
recover from the torpor whose last stage is death.</p>

<p>Now what symptoms herald their return to activity? We know the
symptoms: the tarsi tremble, the palpi quiver, the antennæ wave to
and fro. A man emerging from a deep sleep stretches his limbs, yawns
and rubs his eyes. The insect awaking from the etheric sleep likewise
has its own fashion of marking its recovery of consciousness: it
flutters its tiny digits and the more mobile of its organs.</p>

<p>Let us now consider an insect which, upset by a shock, perturbed by
some sort of <a name="page400"></a>excitement, is believed to be shamming dead, lying on
its back. The return to activity is announced exactly in the same
fashion and in the same order as after the stupefying effect of
ether. First the tarsi quiver; then the palpi and antennæ wave feebly
to and fro.</p>

<p>If the creature were really shamming, what need would it have of
these minute preliminaries to the awakening? Once the danger has
disappeared, or is deemed to have done so, why does the insect not
swiftly get upon its feet, to make off as quickly as possible,
instead of dallying with untimely pretences? I am quite sure that,
once the Bear was gone, the comrade who had shammed dead under the
animal's nose did not think of wasting time in stretching himself or
rubbing his eyes. He jumped up at once and took to his heels.</p>

<p>And the insect is supposed to carry its cunning to the length of
counterfeiting resuscitation down to the least details! No, no and
again no; it would be madness. Those quiverings of the tarsi, those
awakening movements of the palpi and antennæ are the obvious proof of
a genuine torpor, now coming to an end, a torpor similar to that
induced by ether but less intense; they show that the insect struck
motionless by my artifice is not <a name="page401"></a>shamming dead, as the vulgar idiom
has it and as the fashionable theories repeat. It is really
hypnotized.</p>

<p>A shock which disturbs its nerve-centres, an abrupt fright which
seizes upon it reduce it to a state of somnolence like that of the
bird which is swung for a second or two with its head under its wing.
A sudden terror sometimes deprives us human beings of the power of
movement, sometimes kills us. Why should not the insect's organism,
so delicate and subtle, give way beneath the grip of fear and
momentarily succumb? If the emotion be slight, the insect shrinks
into itself for an instant, quickly recovers and makes off; if it be
profound, hypnosis supervenes, with its prolonged immobility.</p>

<p>The insect, which knows nothing of death and therefore cannot
counterfeit it, knows nothing either of suicide, that desperate means
of cutting short excessive misery. No authentic example has ever been
given, to my knowledge, of an animal of any kind robbing itself of
its own life. That those most richly endowed with the capacity of
affection sometimes allow themselves to die of grief I grant you; but
there is a great difference between this and stabbing one's self or
cutting one's throat.</p>
<a name="page402"></a>
<p>Yet the recollection occurs to me of the Scorpion's suicide, sworn to
by some, denied by others. What truth is there in the story of the
Scorpion who, surrounded by a circle of fire, puts an end to his
suffering by stabbing himself with his poisoned sting? Let us see for
ourselves:</p>

<p>Circumstances favour me. I am at this moment rearing, in large
earthen pans, with a bed of sand and with potsherds for shelter, a
hideous menagerie which hardly comes up to my expectations as regards
the study of morals.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> I will profit by it in another way. It
consists of some twenty-four specimens of <i>Buthus occitanus</i>, the
large White Scorpion of the south of France. The odious animal
abounds, always isolated, under the flat stones of the neighbouring
hills, in the sandy spots which enjoy the most sunlight. It has a
detestable reputation.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> For the habits of the White or Languedocian Scorpion,
cf. <i>The Life and Love of the Insect:</i> chaps. xvii. and
xviii.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>On the effects of its sting I personally have nothing to say, having
always avoided, by a little caution, the danger to which my relations
with the formidable captives in my study might have exposed me.
Knowing nothing of it myself, I get people to tell me <a name="page403"></a>of it,
wood-cutters in particular, who from time to time fall victims to
their imprudence. One of them tells me the following story:</p>

<p>"After having my dinner, I was dozing for a moment among my faggots,
when I was roused by a sharp pain. It was like the prick of a red-hot
needle. I clapped my hand to the place. Sure enough, there was
something moving! A Scorpion had crept under my trousers and stung me
in the lower part of the calf. The ugly beast was full as long as my
finger. Like that, sir, like that!"</p>

<p>And, adding gesture to speech, the worthy man extended his great
fore-finger. This size did not surprise me: while insect-hunting, I
have seen Scorpions as large.</p>

<p>"I wanted to go on with my work," he continued, "but I came out in a
cold sweat; and my leg swelled up so you could see it swelling. It
got as big as that, sir, as big as that."</p>

<p>More mimicry. Our friend spreads his two hands round his leg, at a
distance, so as to denote the girth of a small barrel:</p>

<p>"Yes, like that, sir, like that; I had great trouble to get home,
though it was only half a mile away. The swelling crept up and up.
Next day it had got so high."</p>
<a name="page404"></a>
<p>A gesture indicates the height.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, for three days I couldn't stand up. I bore it as well as I
could, with my leg stretched out on a chair. Soda-compresses did the
trick; and there you are, sir, there you are."</p>

<p>Another woodcutter, he adds, was also stung in the lower part of the
leg. He was binding faggots together at some distance and had not the
strength to regain his home. He collapsed by the side of the road.
Some men passing by carried him on their shoulders:</p>

<p>"<i>À la cabro morto, moussu, à la cabro morto!</i>"</p>

<p>The story of the rustic narrator, more versed in mimicry than in
speech, does not seem to me exaggerated. A White Scorpion's sting is
a very serious accident for a human being. When stung by his own
kind, the Scorpion himself quickly succumbs. Here I have something
better than the evidence of strangers: I have my own observations.</p>

<p>I take two healthy specimens from my menagerie and place them
together at the bottom of a glass jar on a layer of sand. Excited
with the tip of a straw which brings them face to face again whenever
they draw <a name="page405"></a>back, the two harassed creatures decide on mortal combat.
Each no doubt attributes to the other the annoyances of which I
myself am the cause. The claws, those weapons of defence, are
displayed in a semicircle and open to keep the adversary at a
distance; the tails, in sudden jerks, are flung forward above the
back; the poison-phials clash together; a tiny drop, limpid as water,
beads the point of the sting.</p>

<p>The fight does not last long. One of the Scorpions receives the full
force of the other's poisoned weapon. It is all over: in a few
minutes the wounded one succumbs. The victor very calmly proceeds to
gnaw the fore-part of the victim's cephalothorax, or, in less crabbed
terms, the bit at which we look for a head and find only the entrance
to a belly. The mouthfuls are small, but long-drawn-out. For four or
five days, almost without a break, the cannibal nibbles at his
murdered comrade. To eat the vanquished, that's good warfare, the
only sort excusable. What I do not understand, nor shall until we tin
the meat on the battle-field for food, is our wars between nations.</p>

<p>We now have authentic information: the Scorpion's sting is fatal,
promptly fatal, to the Scorpion himself. Let us come to the <a name="page406"></a>matter of
suicide, such as it has been described to us. When surrounded by a
circle of live embers, the animal, so we are told, stabs itself with
its sting and finds an end of its torment in voluntary death. This
would be very fine on the creature's part if it were true. We shall
see.</p>

<p>In the centre of a ring of burning charcoal, I place the largest
specimen from my menagerie. The bellows increase the glow. At the
first smart of the heat, the animal moves backwards within the circle
of fire. It collides by inadvertence with the burning barrier. Now
follows a disorderly retreat, in every direction, at random, renewing
the agonizing contact. At each attempt to escape, the burning is
repeated more severely than before. The animal becomes frantic. It
darts forward and scorches itself. In a desperate frenzy, it
brandishes its weapon, crooks it, straightens it, lays it down flat
and raises it again, all with such disorderly haste that I am quite
unable to follow its movements accurately.</p>

<p>The moment ought to have come for the Scorpion to release himself
from his torture with a blow of the stiletto. And indeed, with a
sudden spasm, the long-suffering creature becomes motionless, lies at
full-length, flat <a name="page407"></a>upon the ground. There is not a movement; the
inertia is complete. Is the Scorpion dead? It really looks like it.
Perhaps he has pinked himself with a thrust of his sting that escaped
me in the turmoil of the last efforts. If he has actually stabbed
himself, if he has resorted to suicide, then he is dead beyond a
doubt: we have just seen how quickly he succumbs to his own venom.</p>

<p>In my uncertainty, I pick up the apparently dead body with the tip of
my forceps and lay it on a bed of cool sand. An hour later, the
alleged corpse returns to life, as lusty as before the ordeal. I
repeat the process with a second and third specimen. The results are
the same. After the frantic plunges of the desperate victim, we have
the same sudden inertia, with the creature sprawling flat as though
struck by lightning, and the same return to life on the cool sand.</p>

<p>It seems probable that those who invented the story of the Scorpion
committing suicide were deceived by this sudden swoon, this
paralysing spasm, into which the high temperature of the enclosure
throws the exasperated beast. Too quickly convinced, they left the
victim to burn to death. Had they been less credulous and withdrawn
the animal in good time from its circle of fire, they <a name="page408"></a>would have seen
the apparently dead Scorpion return to life and thus assert its
profound ignorance of suicide.</p>

<p>Apart from man, no living thing knows the last resource of a
voluntary end, because none has a knowledge of death. As for us, to
feel that we have the power to escape from the miseries of life is a
noble prerogative, upon which it is good to meditate, as a sign of
our elevation above the commonalty of the animal world; but in point
of fact it becomes cowardice if from the possibility we pass to
action.</p>

<p>He who proposes to go to that length should at least repeat to
himself what Confucius, the great philosopher of the yellow race,
said five-and-twenty centuries ago. Having surprised a stranger in
the woods fixing to the branch of a tree a rope wherewith to hang
himself, the Chinese sage addressed him in words the gist of which
was as follows:</p>

<p>"However great your misfortunes, the greatest of all would be to
yield to despair. All the rest can be repaired; this one is
irreparable. Do not believe that all is lost for you and try to
convince yourself of a truth which has been proved indisputable by
the experience of the centuries. And that truth <a name="page409"></a>is this: so long as a
man has life, there is no need for him to despair. He may pass from
the greatest misery to the greatest joy, from the greatest misfortune
to the highest felicity. Take courage and, as though you were this
very day beginning to recognize the value of life, strive at every
moment to make the most of it."</p>

<p>This humdrum Chinese philosophy is not without merit. It suggests the
moralizing of the fabulist:</p>

<p>"<i>... Qu'on me rende impotent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cul-de-jatte, goutteux, manchot, pourvu qu'en somme<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Je vive, c'est assez: je suis plus que content.</i>"<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small></p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> "... So powerless let me lie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gout-ridden, legless, armless; if only, after all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live, it is enough: more than content am I."</small></blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes, La Fontaine and Kung the philosopher are right: life is a
serious matter, which it will not do to throw away into the first
bush by the roadside like a useless garment. We must look upon it not
as a pleasure, nor yet as a punishment, but as a duty of which we
have to acquit ourselves as well as we can until we are given leave
to depart.</p>

<p>To anticipate this leave is cowardly and <a name="page410"></a>foolish. The power to
disappear at will through death's trap-door does not justify us in
deserting our post; but it opens to us certain vistas which are
absolutely unknown to the animal.</p>

<p>We alone know how life's pageant closes, we alone can foresee our
end, we alone profess devotion to the dead. Of these high matters
none other has any suspicion. When would-be scientists proclaim
aloud, when they declare that a wretched insect knows the trick of
simulating death, we will ask them to look more closely and not to
confound the hypnosis due to terror with the pretence of a condition
unknown to the animal world.</p>

<p>Ours alone is the clear vision of an end, ours alone the glorious
instinct of the beyond. Here, filling its modest part, speaks the
voice of entomology, saying:</p>

<p>"Have confidence; never did an instinct fail to keep its promises."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<center>THE CRIOCERES</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>I am a stubborn disciple of St. Thomas the Apostle and, before I
agree to anything, I want to see and touch it, not once, but twice,
thrice, an indefinite number of times, until my incredulity bows
beneath the weight of evidence. Well, the Rhynchites<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> have told us
that the build does not determine the instincts, that the tools do
not decide the trade. And now, yes, the Crioceres come and add their
testimony. I question three of them, all common, too common, in my
paddock. At the proper season, I have them before my eyes, without
searching for them, whenever I want to ask them for information.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> A genus of Weevils, the essays upon whom will appear in
a later volume to be entitled <i>The Life of Weevil</i>.&mdash;<i>Translator's
Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The first is the Crioceris of the Lily, or Lily-beetle. Since Latin
words offend our modesty let us just once mention her scientific
name, <i>Crioceris merdigera</i>, LIN., without translating it, or, above
all, repeating it. <a name="page412"></a>Decency forbids. I have never been able to
understand why natural history need inflict upon a lovely flower or
an engaging animal an odious name.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, our Crioceris, so ill-treated by the
nomenclators, is a sumptuous creature. She is nicely shaped, neither
too large nor too small, and a beautiful coral red, with jet-black
head and legs. Everybody knows her who in the spring has ever glanced
at the lily, when its stem is beginning to show in the centre of the
rosette of leaves. A Beetle, of less than the average size and
coloured sealing-wax red, is perched up on the plant. Your hand goes
out to seize her. Forthwith, paralysed with fright, she drops to the
ground.</p>

<p>Let us wait a few days and return to the lily, which is gradually
growing taller and beginning to show its buds, gathered together in a
bundle. The red insect is still there. Further, the leaves, which are
seriously bitten into, are reduced to tatters and soiled with little
heaps of greenish ordure. It looks as if some witchcraft had mashed
up the leaves and then splashed the mess all over the place.</p>

<p>Well, this filth moves, travels slowly along. Let us overcome our
repugnance and poke <a name="page413"></a>the heaps with a straw. We uncover, indeed we
unclothe an ugly, pot-bellied, pale-orange larva. It is the grub of
the Crioceris.</p>

<p>The origin of the garment of which we have just stripped it would be
unmentionable, save in the world of the insect, that manufacturer
devoid of shame. This doublet is, in fact, obtained from the
creature's excretions. Instead of evacuating downwards, on the
superannuated principle, the Crioceris' larva evacuates upwards and
receives upon its back the waste products of the intestine, materials
which move from back to front as each fresh pat is dabbed upon the
others. Réaumur has complacently described how the quilt moves
forward from the tail to the head by wriggling along inclined planes,
making so many dips in the undulating back. There is no need to
return to this stercoral mechanism after the master has done with it.</p>

<p>We now know the reasons that procured the Lily-beetle an ignominious
title, confined to the official records: the grub makes itself an
overcoat of its excrements.</p>

<p>Once the garment is completed so as to cover the whole of the
creature's dorsal surface, the clothing-factory does not cease work
on that score. At the back a fresh hem is added from moment to
moment; but the <a name="page414"></a>overlapping superfluity in front drops off of its own
weight at the same time. The coat of dung is under continual repair,
being renovated and lengthened at one end as it wears and grows
shorter at the other.</p>

<p>Sometimes also the stuff is too thick and the heap capsizes. The
denuded grub recks nothing of the lost overcoat; its obliging
intestine repairs the disaster without delay.</p>

<p>Whether by reason of the clipping that results from the excessive
length of a piece which is always on the loom, or of accidents that
cause a part or the whole of the load to fall off, the grub of the
Crioceris leaves accumulations of dirt in its track, till the lily,
the symbol of purity, becomes a very cess-pool. When the leaves have
been browsed, the stem next loses its cuticle, thanks to the nibbling
of the grub, and is reduced to a ragged distaff. The flowers even,
which have opened by now, are not spared: their beautiful ivory
chalices are changed into latrines.</p>

<p>The perpetrator of the misdeed embarks on his career of defilement
early. I wanted to see him start, to watch him lay the first course
of his excremental masonry. Does he serve an apprenticeship? Does he
work badly at first, then a little better and then <a name="page415"></a>well? I now know
all about it: there is no noviciate, there are no clumsy attempts;
the workmanship is perfect from the outset, the product ejected
spreads over the hinder part. Let me tell you what I saw.</p>

<p>The eggs are laid in May, on the under surface of the leaves, in
short trails averaging from three to six. They are cylindrical,
rounded at both ends, of a bright orange-red, glossy and varnished
with a glutinous wash which makes them stick to the leaves throughout
their length. The hatching takes ten days. The shell of the egg, now
a little wrinkled, but still of a bright orange colour, retains its
position, so that the group of eggs, apart from its slightly withered
appearance, remains just as it was.</p>

<p>The young larva measures a millimetre and a half<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> in length. The
head and legs are black, the rest of the body a dull amber-red. On
the first segment of the thorax is a brown sash, interrupted in the
middle; lastly, there is a small black speck on each side, behind the
third segment. This is the initial costume. Presently orange-red will
take the place of the pale amber. The tiny creature, which is
exceedingly fat, sticks to the leaf with its short legs and also with
its <a name="page416"></a>hind-quarters, which act as a lever and push the round belly
forwards. The motion reminds you of a cripple sitting in a bowl.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> .959 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The grubs emerging from any one group of eggs at once begin to
browse, each beside the empty skin of its egg. Here, singly, they
nibble and dig themselves a little pit in the thickness of the leaf,
while sparing the cuticle of the opposite surface. This leaves a
translucent floor, a support which enables them to consume the walls
of the excavation without risking a fall.</p>

<p>Seeking for better pasture, they move lazily on. I see them scattered
at random; a few of them are grouped in the same trench; but I never
see them browsing economically abreast as Réaumur relates. There is
no order, no understanding between messmates, contemporaries though
they be and all sprung from the same row of eggs. Nor is any heed
paid to economy: the lily is so generous!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the paunch swells and the intestine labours. Here we are!
I see the first bit of the overcoat evacuated. As is natural in
extreme infancy, it is liquid and there is not much of it. The scanty
flow is used all the same and is laid methodically, right at the far
end of the back. Let the <a name="page417"></a>little grub be. In less than a day, piece by
piece, it will have made itself a suit.</p>

<p>The artist is a master from the first attempt. If its baby-flannel is
so good to start with, what will the future ulster be, when the
stuff, brought to perfection, is of much better quality? Let us
proceed; we know what we want to know concerning the talents of this
manufacturer of excremental broadcloth.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of this nasty great-coat? Does the grub employ it
to keep itself cool, to protect itself against the attacks of the
sun? It is possible: a tender skin need not be afraid of blistering
under such a soothing poultice. Is it the grub's object to disgust
its enemies? This again is possible: who would venture to set tooth
to such a heap of filth? Or can it be simply a caprice of fashion, an
outlandish fancy? I will not say no. We have had the crinoline, that
senseless bulwark of steel hoops; we still have the extravagant
stove-pipe hat, which tries to mould our heads in its stiff sheath.
Let us be indulgent to the evacuator nor disparage his eccentric
wardrobe. We have eccentricities of our own.</p>

<p>To feel our way a little in this delicate question, we will question
the near kinsmen <a name="page418"></a>of the Lily-beetle. In my acre or two of pebbles I
have planted a bed of asparagus. The crop, from the culinary point of
view, will never repay me for my trouble: I am rewarded in another
fashion. On the scanty shoots which I allow to display themselves
freely in plumes of delicate green, two Crioceres abound in the
spring: the field species (<i>C. campestris</i>, LIN.) and the
twelve-spotted species (<i>C. duodecimpunctata</i>, LIN.). A splendid
windfall, far better than any bundle of asparagus.</p>

<p>The first has a tricolor costume which is not without merit. Blue
wing-cases, braided with white on the outer edge and each adorned
with three white dots; a red corselet, with a blue disk in the
centre. Its eggs are olive-green and cylindrical and, instead of
lying flat, grouped in short lines, after the manner of the
lily-dweller's, occur singly and stand on end on the leaves of the
asparagus-plant, on the twigs, on the flower-buds, more or less
everywhere, without any fixed order.</p>

<p>Though living in the open air on the leaves of its plant and thus
exposed to all the various perils that may threaten the Lily-grub,
the larva of the Field Crioceris knows nothing whatever of the art of
sheltering itself <a name="page419"></a>beneath a layer of ordure. It goes through life
naked and always perfectly clean.</p>

<p>It is of a bright greenish yellow, fairly fat behind and thinner in
front. Its principal organ of locomotion is the end of the intestine,
which protrudes, curves like a flexible finger, clasps the twig and
supports the creature while pushing it forward. The true legs, which
are short and placed too far in front with regard to the length of
the body, would find it very difficult by themselves to drag the
heavy mass that comes after. Their assistant, the anal finger, is
remarkably strong. With no support, the larva turns over, head
downwards, and remains suspended when shifting from one sprig to
another. This Jack-in-the-bowl is a rope-dancer, a consummate
acrobat, performing its evolutions amid the slender sprigs without
fear of a fall.</p>

<p>Its attitude in repose is curious. The heavy stern rests on the two
hind-legs and especially on the crooked finger, the end of the
intestine. The fore-part is lifted in a graceful curve, the little
black head is raised and the creature looks rather like the crouching
Sphinx of antiquity. This pose is common at times of slumber and
blissful digestion in the sun.</p>
<a name="page420"></a>
<p>An easy prey is this naked, plump, defenceless grub, snoozing in the
heat of a blazing day. Various Gnats, of humble size, but very likely
terribly treacherous, haunt the foliage of the asparagus. The larva
of the Crioceris, motionless in its sphinx-like attitude, does not
appear to be on its guard against them, even when they come buzzing
above its rump. Can they be as harmless as their peaceful frolics
seem to proclaim? It is extremely doubtful: the Fly rabble are not
there merely to imbibe the scanty exudations of the plant. Experts in
mischief, they have no doubt hastened hither with another object.</p>

<p>And, in truth, on the greater number of the Crioceris-larvæ we find,
adhering firmly to the skin, certain white specks, very small and of
a china-white. Can these be the sowing of a bandit, the spawn of a
Midge?</p>

<p>I collect the grubs marked with these white specks and rear them in
captivity. A month later, about the middle of June, they shrivel,
wrinkle and turn brown. All that is left of them is a dry skin which
tears from end to end, half uncovering a Fly-pupa. A few days later,
the parasite emerges.</p>

<p>It is a small, greyish Fly, fiercely bristling with sparse hairs,
half the size of the <a name="page421"></a>House-fly, whom it resembles slightly. It belongs
to the Tachina group, who, in their larval form, so often inhabit the
bodies of caterpillars.</p>

<p>The white spots sprinkled over the larva of the Crioceris were the
eggs of the hateful Fly. The vermin born of those eggs have
perforated the victim's paunch. By subtle wounds, which cause little
pain and are almost immediately healed, they have penetrated the
body, reaching the humours in which the entrails are bathed. At first
the larva invaded is not aware of its danger; it continues to perform
its rope-dancer's gymnastics, to fill its belly and to take its
siestas in the sun, as though nothing serious had occurred.</p>

<p>Reared in a glass tube and often examined under the lens, my
parasite-ridden larvæ betray no uneasiness. The fact is that the
Tachina's children display an infernal judgment in their first
actions. Until the moment when they are ready for the transformation,
their portion of game has to hold out, must be kept fresh and alive.
They therefore gorge themselves with the reserves intended for future
use, the fats, the savings which the Crioceris hoards in view of the
remodelling whence the perfect insect <a name="page422"></a>will emerge; they consume what
is not essential to the life of the moment and are very careful not
to touch the organs which are indispensable at the present time. If
these received a bite, the host would die and so would they. Towards
the end of their growth, prudence and discretion being no longer
essential, they make a complete clearance of the victim, leaving only
the skin, which will serve them for a shelter.</p>

<p>One satisfaction is vouchsafed me in these horrible orgies: I see
that the Tachina in her turn is subjected to severe reductions. How
many were there on the larva's back? Perhaps eight, ten or more. One
Midge, never more than one, comes out of the victim's skin, for the
morsel is too small to provide food for many. What has become of the
others? Has there been an internecine battle inside the poor wretch's
body? Have they eaten one another up, leaving only the strongest to
survive, or the one most favoured by the chances of the fight? Or has
one of them, earlier developed than the rest, found himself master of
the stronghold and have the others preferred to die outside rather
than enter a grub already occupied, where famine would be rife if the
messmates numbered even two? I am all for mutual <a name="page423"></a>extermination.
Kinsman's flesh or stranger's flesh must be all one to the fangs of
the vermin swarming in the Crioceris' belly.</p>

<p>Fierce though the competition is among these bandits, the Beetle's
race does not threaten to die out. I review the innumerable troop on
my asparagus-bed. A good half of them have Tachina-eggs plainly
visible as tiny white specks on their green skins. The blemished
larvæ tell me of a paunch already or on the point of being invaded.
On the other hand, it is doubtful whether those which are unscathed
will all remain in that condition. The malefactor is incessantly
prowling around the green plumes, watching for a favourable
opportunity. Many larvæ free from white spots to-day will show them
to-morrow or some other day, so long as the Fly's season lasts.</p>

<p>I estimate that the vast majority of the troop will end by being
infested. My rearing-experiments tell me much on this point. If I do
not make a careful selection when I am stocking my wire-gauze-covers,
if I go to work at random in picking the branches colonized with
larvæ, I obtain very few adult Crioceres; nearly all of them are
resolved into a cloud of Midges.</p>

<p>If it were possible for us to wage war <a name="page424"></a>effectually upon an insect, I
should advise asparagus-growers to have recourse to the Tachina,
though I should cherish no illusions touching the results of the
expedient. The exclusive tastes of the insect auxiliary draw us into
a vicious circle: the remedy allays the evil, but the evil is
inseparable from the remedy. To rid ourselves of the ravages of the
asparagus-beds, we should need a great many Tachinæ; and to obtain a
great many Tachinæ we should first of all need a great many ravagers.
Nature's equilibrium balances things as a whole. Whenever Crioceres
abound, the Midges that reduce them arrive in numbers; when Crioceres
become rare, the Midges decrease, but are always ready to return in
masses and repress a surplus of the others during a return of
prosperity.</p>

<p>Under its thick mantle of ordure the grub of the Lily-beetle escapes
the troubles so fatal to its cousin of the asparagus. Strip it of its
overcoat: you will never find the terrible white specks upon its
skin. The method of preservation is most effective.</p>

<p>Would it not be possible to find a defensive system of equal value
without resorting to detestable filth? Yes, of course: the insect
need only house itself under a covering <a name="page425"></a>where there would be nothing
to fear from the Fly's eggs. This is what the Twelve-spotted
Crioceris does, occupying the same quarters as the Field Crioceris,
from whom she differs in size, being rather larger, and still more in
her costume, which is rusty red all over, with twelve black spots
distributed symmetrically on the wing-cases.</p>

<p>Her eggs, which are a deep olive-green and cylindrical, pointed at
one pole and squared off at the other, closely resemble those of the
Field Crioceris and, like these, usually stand up on the supporting
surface, to which they are fastened by the square end. It would be
easy to confuse the two if we had not the position which they occupy
to guide us. The Field Crioceris fastens her eggs to the leaves and
the thin sprays; the other plants them exclusively on the still green
fruit of the asparagus, globules the size of a pea.</p>

<p>The grubs have to open a tiny passage for themselves and to make
their own way into the fruit, of which they eat the pulp. Each
globule harbours one larva, no more, or the ration would be
insufficient. Often, however, I see two, three or four eggs on the
same fruit. The first grub hatched is <a name="page426"></a>the one favoured by luck. He
becomes the owner of the pill, an intolerant owner capable of
wringing the neck of any who should come and sit down at table beside
him. Always and everywhere this pitiless competition!</p>

<p>The grub of the Twelve-spotted Crioceris is a dull white, with an
interrupted black scarf on the first segment of the thorax. This
sedentary creature has none of the talents of the acrobat grazing on
the swaying foliage of the asparagus; it cannot take a grip with its
posterior, turned into a prehensile finger. What use would it have
for such a prerogative, loving repose as it does and destined to put
on fat in its cell, without roaming in quest of food? In the same
group each species has its own gifts, according to the kind of life
that awaits it.</p>

<p>It is not long before the occupied fruit falls to the ground. Day by
day, it loses its green colour as the pulp is consumed. It becomes,
at last, a pretty, diaphanous opal sphere, while the berries which
have not been injured ripen on the plant and acquire a rich scarlet
hue.</p>

<p>When there is nothing left to eat inside the skin of its pill, the
grub makes a hole in it and goes underground. The Tachinæ <a name="page427"></a>have spared
it. Its opal box, the hard rind of the berry, has ensured its safety
just as well as a filthy overcoat would have done and perhaps even
better.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>
<center>THE CRIOCERES (<i>continued</i>)</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Crioceris has found safety inside its opal globe. Safety? Ah, but
what an unfortunate expression I have used! Is there any one in the
world who can flatter himself that he has escaped the spoiler?</p>

<p>In the middle of July, at the time when the Twelve-spotted Crioceris
comes up from under the ground in the adult form, my rearing-jars
yield me swarms of a very small Gall-fly, a slender, graceful,
blue-black Chalcid, without any visible boring-tool. Has the puny
creature a name? Have the nomenclators catalogued it? I do not know,
nor do I much care; the main thing is to learn that the covering of
the asparagus-berry, which becomes an opal globe when the grub has
emptied it, has failed to save the recluse. The Tachina-midge drains
her victim by herself; this other, tinier creature feasts in company.
Twenty or more of them batten on the grub together.</p>

<p>When everything seems to foretell a quiet <a name="page429"></a>life, a pigmy among pigmies
appears, charged with the express duty of exterminating an insect
which is protected first by the casket of the berry and next by the
shell, the underground work of the grub. To eat the Twelve-spotted
Crioceris is its mission in life, its special function. When and how
does it deliver its attack? I do not know.</p>

<p>At any rate, proud of her vocation and finding life sweet, the
Chalcid curls her antennæ into a crook and waves them to and fro: she
rubs her tarsi together, a sign of satisfaction; she dusts her belly.
I can hardly see her with the naked eye; and yet she is an agent of
the universal extermination, a wheel in the implacable machine which
crushes life as in a wine-press.</p>

<p>The tyranny of the belly turns the world into a robber's cave. Eating
means killing. Distilled in the alembic of the stomach, the life
destroyed by slaughter becomes so much fresh life. Everything is
melted down again, everything has a fresh beginning in death's
insatiable furnace.</p>

<p>Man, from the alimentary point of view, is the chief brigand,
consuming everything that lives or might live. Here is a mouthful of
bread, the sacred food. It represents a certain number of grains of
wheat which <a name="page430"></a>asked only to sprout, to turn green in the sun, to shoot
up into tall stalks crowned with ears. They died that we might live.
Here are some eggs. Left undisturbed with the Hen, they would have
emitted the Chickens' gentle cheep. They died that we might live.
Here is beef, mutton, poultry. Horror, it smells of blood, it is
eloquent of murder! If we gave it a thought, we should not dare to
sit down to table, that altar of cruel sacrifices.</p>

<p>How many lives does the Swallow, to mention only the most peaceable,
harvest in the course of a single day! From morning to evening he
gulps down Crane-flies, Gnats and Midges joyously dancing in the
sunbeams. Quick as lightning he passes; and the dancers are
decimated. They perish; then their melancholy remnants fall from the
nest containing the young brood, in the form of guano which becomes
the turf's inheritance. And so it is with all and everything, with
large and small, from end to end of the animal progression. A
perpetual massacre perpetuates the flux of life.</p>

<p>Appalled by these butcheries, the thinker begins to dream of a state
of affairs which would free us from the horrors of the maw. This
ideal of innocence, as our poor nature <a name="page431"></a>vaguely sees it, is not an
impossibility; it is partly realized for all of us, men and animals.</p>

<p>Breathing is the most imperious of needs. We live by the air before
we live by bread; and this happens of itself, without painful
struggles, without costly labour, almost without our knowledge. We do
not set out, armed for war, to conquer the air by rapine, violence,
cunning, barter and desperate labour; the supreme element of life
enters our bodies of its own accord; it penetrates us and quickens
us. Each of us has his generous share of it without giving the matter
a thought.</p>

<p>To crown perfection, it is free. And this will last indefinitely
until an ever ingenious Treasury invents distributing-taps and
pneumatic receivers from which the air will be doled out to us at so
much a piston-stroke. Let us hope that we shall be spared this
particular item of scientific progress, for that, woe betide us,
would be the end of all things: the tax would kill the tax-payer!</p>

<p>Chemistry, in its lighter moods, promises us, in the future, pills
containing the concentrated essence of food. These cunning compounds,
the product of our laboratories, would not end our longing to possess
a <a name="page432"></a>stomach no more burdensome than our lungs and to feed even as we
breathe.</p>

<p>The plant partly knows this secret: it draws its carbon quietly from
the air, in which each leaf is impregnated with the wherewithal to
grow tall and green. But the vegetable is inactive; hence its
innocent life. Action calls for strongly flavoured spices, won by
fighting. The animal acts; therefore it kills. The highest phase,
perhaps, of a self-conscious intelligence, man, deserving nothing
better, shares with the brute the tyranny of the belly as the
irresistible motive of action.</p>

<p>But I have wandered too far afield. A living speck, swarming in the
paunch of a grub, tells us of the brigandage of life. How well it
understands its trade as an exterminator! In vain does the
Crioceris-larva take refuge in an unassailable casket: its
executioner makes herself so small that she is able to reach it.</p>

<p>Adopt such precautions as you please, you pitiable grubs, pose on
your sprigs in the attitude of a threatening Sphinx, take refuge in
the mysteries of a box, arm yourself with a cuirass of dung: you will
none the less pay your tribute in the pitiless conflict; there will
<a name="page433"></a>always be operators who, varying in cunning, in size, in implements,
will inoculate you with their deadly germs.</p>

<p>Not even the lily-dweller, with her dirty ways, is safe. Her grub is
as often the prey of another Tachina, larger than that of the Field
Crioceris. The parasite, I am convinced, does not sow her eggs upon
the victim so long as the latter is wrapped in its repulsive
great-coat; but a moment's imprudence gives her a favourable
opportunity.</p>

<p>When the time comes for the grub to bury itself in the ground, there
to undergo the transformation, it lays aside its mantle, with the
object perhaps of easing itself when it descends from the top of the
plant, or else with the object of taking a bath in that kindly
sunlight whereof it has hitherto tasted so little under its moist
coverlet. This naked journey over the leaves, the last joy of its
larval life, is fatal to the traveller. Up comes the Tachina, who,
finding a clean skin, all sleek with fat, loses no time in dabbing
her eggs upon it.</p>

<p>A census of the intact and of the injured larvæ provides us with
particulars which agree with what we foresaw from the nature of their
respective lives. The most exposed to parasites is the Field
Crioceris, <a name="page434"></a>whose larva lives in the open air, without any sort of
protection. Next comes the Twelve-spotted Crioceris, who is
established in the asparagus-berry from her early infancy. The most
favoured is the Lily-beetle, who, while a grub, makes an ulster of
her excretions.</p>

<p>For the second time, we are here confronted by three insects which
look as if they had all come out of one mould, so much are they alike
in shape. If the costumes were not different and the sizes
dissimilar, we should not know how to tell one from another. And this
pronounced resemblance in figure is accompanied by a no less
pronounced lack of resemblance in instinct.</p>

<p>The evacuator that soils its back cannot have inspired the hermit
living in cleanly retirement inside its globe; the occupant of the
asparagus-berry did not advise the third to live in the open and
wander like an acrobat through the leafage. None of the three has
initiated the customs of the other two. All this seems to me as clear
as daylight. If they have issued from the same stock, how have they
acquired such dissimilar talents?</p>

<p>Furthermore, have these talents developed by degrees? The Lily-beetle
is prepared to tell us. Her grub, let us suppose, once conceived the
notion, when tormented by the <a name="page435"></a>Tachina, of making the stercoral slit
open above. By accident, with no definite purpose in view, it emptied
the contents of its intestine over its back. The natty Fly hesitated
in the presence of this filth. The grub, in its cunning, recognized,
as time went on, the benefit to be derived from its poultice; and
what at first was an unpremeditated pollution became a prudent
custom.</p>

<p>As success followed upon success, with the aid of the centuries, of
course, for these inventions always take centuries, the dung overcoat
was extended from the hinder end to the fore-part, right down to the
forehead. Finding itself the gainer by this invention, setting the
parasite at defiance under its coverlet, the grub made a strict law
of what was an accident; and the Crioceris faithfully handed down the
repulsive great-coat to her offspring.</p>

<p>So far this is not so bad. But things now begin to become
complicated. If the insect was really the inventor of its defensive
methods, if it discovered for itself the advantage of hiding under
its ordure, I look to its ingenuity to keep up the tricks until the
precise moment has come for burying itself. But, on the contrary, it
undresses itself some time beforehand; it wanders about naked, taking
<a name="page436"></a>the air on the leaves, at a time when its fair round belly is more
than ever likely to tempt the Fly. It completely forgets, on its last
day, the prudence which it acquired by the long apprenticeship of the
centuries.</p>

<p>This sudden change of purpose, this heedlessness in the face of
danger tells me that the insect forgets nothing, because it has
learnt nothing, because it has invented nothing. When the instincts
were being distributed, it received as its share the overcoat, of
whose methods it is ignorant, though it benefits by its advantages.
It has not acquired it by successive stages, followed by a sudden
halt at the most dangerous moment, the moment most calculated to
inspire it with distrust; it is no more and no less gifted than it
was in the beginning and is unable in any way to alter its tactics
against the Tachina and its other enemies.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we must not be in a hurry to attribute to the garment
of filth the exclusive function of protecting the grub against the
parasite. It is difficult to see in what respect the Lily-grub is
more deserving than the Asparagus-grub, which possesses no defensive
arts. Perhaps it is less fruitful and, to make up for the poverty of
the ovaries, boasts an ingenuity which safeguards the <a name="page437"></a>race. Nor is
there anything to tell us that the soft coverlet is not at the same
time a shelter which screens a too sensitive skin from the sun. And,
if it were a mere fal-lal, a furbelow of larval coquetry, even that
would not surprise me. The insect has tastes which we cannot judge by
our own. Let us end with a doubt and proceed.</p>

<p>May is not over when the grub, now fully-grown, leaves the lily and
buries itself at the foot of the plant, at no great depth. Working
with its head and rump, it forces back the earth and makes itself a
round recess, the size of a pea. To turn the cell into a hollow pill
which will not be liable to collapse, all that remains for it to do
is to drench the wall with a glue which soon sets and grips the sand.</p>

<p>To observe this work of consolidation, I unearth some unfinished
cells and make an opening which enables me to watch the grub at work.
The hermit is at the window in a moment. A stream of froth pours from
his mouth like beaten-up white of egg. He slavers, spits profusely;
he makes his product effervescence and lays it on the edge of the
breach. With a few spurts of froth the opening is plugged.</p>

<p>I collect other grubs at the moment of <a name="page438"></a>their interment and install
them in glass tubes with a few tiny bits of paper which will serve
them as a prop. There is no sand, no building-material other than the
creature's spittle and my very few shreds of paper. Under these
conditions can the pill-shaped cell be constructed?</p>

<p>Yes, it can; and without much difficulty. Supporting itself partly on
the glass, partly on the paper, the larva begins to slaver all around
it, to froth copiously. After a spell of some hours, it has
disappeared within a solid shell. This is white as snow and highly
porous; it might almost be a globule of whipped albumen. Thus, to
stick together the sand in its pill-shaped nest, the larva employs a
frothy albuminous substance.</p>

<p>Let us now dissect the builder. Around the oesophagus, which is
fairly long and soft, are no salivary glands, no silk-tubes. The
frothy cement is therefore neither silk nor saliva. One organ forces
itself upon our attention: it is the crop, which is very capacious,
and dilated with irregular protuberances that put it out of shape. It
is filled with a colourless, viscous fluid. This is certainly the raw
material of the frothy spittle, the glue that binds the grains of
sand together and consolidates them into a spherical whole.</p>
<a name="page439"></a>
<p>When the preparations for the metamorphosis are at hand, the
stomachic pouch, having no longer to do duty as a digestive
laboratory, serves the insect as a factory, or a warehouse for
different purposes. Here the Sitares store up their uric waste
products; here the Capricorns collect the chalky paste which becomes
the stone lid for the entrance to the cell; here caterpillars keep in
reserve the gums and powders with which they strengthen the cocoon;
hence the Hymenoptera draw the lacquer which they employ to upholster
their silken edifice. And now we find the Lily-beetle using it as a
store for frothy cement.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> What an obliging organ is this digestive
pouch!</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> This subject is continued in the essay on the Foamy
Cicadella. Cf. <i>The Life of the Grasshopper:</i> chap.
xx.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The two Asparagus-beetles are likewise proficient dribblers, worthy
rivals of their kinswoman of the lily in the matter of building. In
all three cases the underground shell has the same shape and the same
structure.</p>

<p>When, after a subterranean visit of two months' duration, the
Lily-beetle returns to the surface in her adult form, a botanical
problem remains to be solved before the history of the insect is
completed. We are <a name="page440"></a>now at the height of summer. The lilies have had
their day. A dry, leafless stick, surmounted by a few tattered
capsules, is all that is left of the magnificent plant of the spring.
Only the onion-like bulb remains a little way down. There, postponing
the process of vegetation, it waits for the steady rains of the
autumn, which will renew its strength and make it burgeon into a
sheaf of leaves.</p>

<p>How does the Lily-beetle live during the summer, before the return of
the green foliage dear to its race? Does it fast during the extreme
heat? If abstinence is its rule of life in this season of vegetable
dearth, why does it emerge from underground, why does it abandon its
shell, where it could sleep so peacefully, without the necessity of
eating? Can it be need of food that drives it from the substratum and
sends it to the sunlight so soon as the wing-cases have assumed their
vermilion hue? It is very likely. For the rest, let us look into the
matter.</p>

<p>On the ruined stems of my white lilies I find a portion covered with
a scrap of green skin. I set it before the prisoners in my jars, who
emerged from their sandy bed a day or two ago. They attack it with an
appetite which is extremely conclusive; the green <a name="page441"></a>morsel is stripped
bare to the wood. Soon I have nothing left, in the way of their
regulation diet, to offer my famished captives. I know that all the
lilies, native or exotic, the Turk's cap lily, or Martagon, the lily
of Chalcedon, the tiger lily and many others, are to their taste; I
do not forget that the crown imperial fritillary and the Persian
fritillary are equally welcome; but most of these delicate plants
have refused the hospitality of my two acres of pebbles and those
which it is more or less possible for me to grow are now as tattered
as the common lily. There is not a patch of green left on them.</p>

<p>In botany the lily gives its name to the family of the Liliaceæ, of
which it is the leading representative. Those who feed upon the lily
ought also, in the absence of anything better, to accept the other
plants of the same group. This is my opinion at first; it is not that
of the Crioceris, who knows more than I do about the virtues of
plants.</p>

<p>The family of the Liliaceæ is subdivided into three tribes: the
lilies, the daffodils and the asparaguses. Not any of the daffodil
tribe suit my famishing prisoners, who allow themselves to die of
inanition on the leaves of the following genera, the only varieties
<a name="page442"></a>with which the modest resources of my garden have allowed me to
experiment: asphodel, funkia, or niobe, agapanthus, or African lily,
tritelia, hemerocallis, or day lily, tritoma, garlic, ornithogalum,
or star of Bethlehem, squill, hyacinth, muscari, or grape-hyacinth. I
record, for whom it may concern, this profound contempt of the
Crioceris for the daffodils. An insect's opinion is not to be
despised: it tells us that we should obtain a more natural
arrangement by separating the daffodils farther from the lilies.</p>

<p>In the first of the three tribes, the classic white lily, the plant
preferred by the insect, takes the chief place; next come the other
lilies and the fritillaries, a diet almost as much sought after; and
lastly the tulips, which the season is too far advanced to allow me
to submit for the approval of the Crioceris.</p>

<p>The third tribe had a great surprise in store for me. The red
Crioceris fed, though with a very scornful tooth, on the foliage of
the asparagus, the favourite dish of the Field Crioceris and the
Twelve-spotted Crioceris. On the other hand, she feasted rapturously
on the lily of the valley (<i>Convallaria maialis</i>) and on Solomon's
seal (<i>Polygonatum vulgare</i>), both of which are so different from the
<a name="page443"></a>lily to any eye untrained in the niceties of botanical analysis.</p>

<p>She did more: she browsed, with every appearance of a contented
stomach, on a prickly creeper, <i>Smilax aspera</i>, which tangles itself
in the hedges with its corkscrew tendrils and produces, in the
autumn, graceful clusters of small red berries, which are used for
Christmas decorations. The fully-developed leaves are too hard for
her, too tough; she wants the tender tips of the nascent foliage.
When I take this precaution, I can feed her on the intractable vine
as readily as on the lily.</p>

<p>The fact that the smilax is accepted gives me confidence in the
prickly butcher's-broom (<i>Ruscus aculeatus</i>), another shrub of sturdy
constitution, admitted to the family rejoicings at Christmas because
of its handsome green leaves and its red berries, which are like big
coral beads. In order not to discourage the consumer with leaves that
are too hard, I select some young seedlings, newly sprouted and still
bearing the round berry, the nutritive gourd, hanging at their base.
My precautions lead to nothing: the insect obstinately refuses the
butcher's-broom, on which I thought that I might rely after the
smilax had been accepted.</p>
<a name="page444"></a>
<p>We have our botany; the Crioceris has hers, which is subtler in its
appreciation of affinities. Her domain comprises two very natural
groups, that of the lily and that of the smilax, which, with the
advance of science, has become the family of the Smilaceæ. In these
two groups she recognizes certain genera&mdash;the more numerous&mdash;as her
own; she refuses the others, which ought perhaps to be revised before
being finally classified.</p>

<p>An exclusive taste for the asparagus, one of the foremost
representatives of the Smilaceæ, characterizes the two other
Crioceres, those eager exploiters of the cultivated asparagus. I find
them also pretty often on the needle-leaved asparagus (<i>A.
acutifolius</i>), a forbidding-looking shrub with long, flexible stems
bearing many branches, which the Provençal vine-grower uses, under
the name of <i>roumiéu</i>, as a filter before the tap of the wine-vat, to
prevent the refuse of the grapes from choking up the vent-hole. Apart
from these two plants, the two Crioceres refuse absolutely
everything, even when in July they come up from the earth with the
famishing stomachs which the long fast of the metamorphosis has given
them. On the same wild asparagus, disdainful of the rest, lives a
fourth Crioceris (<i>C. paracenthesia</i>), the <a name="page445"></a>smallest of the group. I
do not know enough of her habits to say anything more about her.</p>

<p>These botanical details tell us that the Crioceres, which hatch
early, in the middle of summer, have no reason to fear famine. If the
Lily-beetle can no longer find her favourite plant, she can browse
upon Solomon's seal and smilax, not to mention the lily of the valley
and, I dare say, a few others of the same family. The other three are
more favoured. Their food-plant remains erect, green and well
provided with leaves until the end of autumn. The wild asparagus
even, undaunted by the extreme cold, maintains a sturdy existence all
the year round. Belated resources, moreover, are superfluous. After a
brief period of summer freedom, the various Crioceres seek their
winter quarters and go to earth under the dead leaves.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>
<center>THE CLYTHRÆ</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Lily-beetle dresses herself: with her ordure she makes herself a
cosy gown, an infamous garment, it is true, but an excellent
protection against parasites and sunstroke. The weaver of fæcal cloth
has hardly any imitators. The Hermit-crab dresses himself: he selects
to fit him, from the discarded wardrobe of the Sea-snail, an empty
shell, damaged by the waves; he slips his poor abdomen, which is
incapable of hardening, inside it and leaves outside his great fists
of unequal size, clad in stone boxing-gloves. This is yet another
example rarely followed.</p>

<p>With a few exceptions, all the more remarkable because they are so
rare, the animal, in fact, is not burdened by the need of clothing
itself. Endowed, without having to manufacture a thing, with all that
it wants, it knows nothing of the art of adding defensive extras to
its natural covering.</p>

<p>The bird has no need to take thought of <a name="page447"></a>its plumage, the furry beast
of its coat, the reptile of its scales, the Snail of his shell, the
Ground-beetle of his jerkin. They display no ingenuity with the
object of securing protection from the inclemencies of the
atmosphere. Hair, down, scales, mother-of-pearl and other items of
the animal's apparel: these are all produced of their own accord, on
an automatic loom.</p>

<p>Man, for his part, is naked; and the severities of the climate oblige
him to wear an artificial skin to protect his own. This poverty has
given rise to one of our most attractive industries.</p>

<p>He invented clothing who, shivering with cold, first thought of
flaying the Bear and covering his shoulders with the brute's hide. In
a distant future this primitive cloak was gradually to be replaced by
cloth, the product of our industry. But under a mild sky the
traditional fig-leaf, the screen of modesty, was for a long while
sufficient. Among peoples remote from civilization, it still suffices
in our day, together with its ornamental complement, the fish-bone
through the cartilage of the nose, the red feather in the hair, the
string round the loins. We must not forget the smear of rancid
butter, which serves to keep off the Mosquito and reminds us of the
<a name="page448"></a>unguent employed by the grub that dreads the Tachina.</p>

<p>In the first rank of the animals protected against the bite of the
atmosphere without the intervention of a handicraft are those which
go clad in hair, dressed free of cost in fleeces, furs or pelts. Some
of these natural coats are magnificent, surpassing our downiest
velvets in softness.</p>

<p>Despite the progress of weaving, man is still jealous of them.
To-day, as in the ages when he sheltered under a rock, he values furs
greatly for the winter. At all seasons he holds them in high esteem
as ornamental accessories; he glories in sewing on his attire a shred
of some wretched flayed beast. The ermine of kings and judges, the
white rabbit-tails with which the university graduate adorns his left
shoulder on solemn occasions carry us back in thought to the age of
the cave-dwellers.</p>

<p>Moreover, the fleecy animals still clothe us in a less primitive
fashion. Our woollens are made of hairs interlaced. Ever since the
beginning, without hoping to find anything better, man has clothed
himself at the expense of the hairy orders of creation.</p>

<p>The bird, a more active producer of heat, <a name="page449"></a>whose maintenance is a more
delicate matter, covers itself with feathers, which overlap evenly,
and puts round its body a thick cushion of air on a bed of down. It
has on its tail a pot of cosmetic, a bottle of hair-oil, a fatty
gland from which the beak obtains an ointment wherewith it preens the
feathers one by one and renders them impermeable to moisture. A great
expender of energy by reason of the exigencies of flight, it is
essentially, chilly creature that it is, better-adapted than any
other to the retention of heat.</p>

<p>For the slow-moving reptile the scales suffice, preserving it from
hurtful contacts, but playing hardly any part as a bulwark against
changes of temperature.</p>

<p>In its liquid environment, which is far more constant than the air,
the fish requires no more. Without effort on its part, without
violent expenditure of motor force, the swimmer is borne up by the
mere pressure of the water. A bath whose temperature varies but
little enables it to live in ignorance of excessive cold or heat.</p>

<p>In the same way, the mollusc, for the most part a denizen of the
seas, leads a blissful life in its shell, which is a defensive
fortress <a name="page450"></a>rather than a garment. Lastly the crustacean confines itself
to making a suit of armour out of its mineral skin.</p>

<p>In all these, from the hairy to the crustaceous, the real coat, the
coat turned out by a special industry, does not exist. Hair, fur,
feather, scale, shell, stony armour require no intervention of the
wearer; they are natural products, not the artificial creations of
the animal. To find clothiers able to place upon their backs that
which their organization refuses them, we must descend from man to
certain insects.</p>

<p>Ridiculous attire, of which we are so proud, made from the slaver of
a caterpillar or the fleece of a silly sheep: among its inventors the
first and foremost is the Crioceris-larva, with its jacket of dung!
In the art of clothing itself, it preceded the Eskimo, who scrapes
the bowels of the seal to make himself a suit of dittos; it
forestalled our ancestor the troglodyte, who borrowed the fur-coat of
his contemporary the Cave-bear. We had not got beyond the fig-leaf,
when the Crioceris already excelled in the manufacture of homespun,
both providing the raw material and piecing it together.</p>

<p>For reasons of economy and easy acquisition, its disgusting method,
but with very <a name="page451"></a>elegant modifications, suits the clan of the Clythræ
and Cryptocephali, those pretty and magnificently coloured Beetles.
Their larva, a naked little grub, makes itself a long, narrow pot, in
which it lives just like the Snail in his shell. As a coat and as a
dwelling the timid creature makes use of a jar, better still, of a
graceful vase, the product of its industry.</p>

<p>Once inside, it never comes out. If anything alarms it, with a sudden
recoil it withdraws completely into its urn, the opening of which is
closed with the disk formed by the flat top of the head. When quiet
is restored, it ventures to put out its head and the three segments
with legs to them, but is very careful to keep the rest, which is
more delicate and fastened to the back, inside.</p>

<p>With tiny steps, weighted by the burden, it makes its way along,
lifting its earthenware container behind it in a slanting position.
It makes one think of Diogenes, dragging his house, a terra-cotta
tub, about with him. The thing is rather unwieldy, because of the
weight, and is liable to heel over, owing to the excessive height of
the centre of gravity. It makes progress all the same, tilting like a
busby rakishly cocked over one ear. One of our Land-snails, the
Bulimus, whose shell is <a name="page452"></a>continued into a turret, moves almost in the
same fashion, tumbling repeatedly as he goes.</p>

<p>The Clythra's is a shapely jar and does credit to the insect's art of
pottery. It is firm to the touch, of earthy appearance and smooth as
stucco inside, while the outside is relieved by delicate diagonal,
symmetrical ribs, which are the traces of successive enlargements.
The back part is slightly dilated and is rounded off at the end with
two slight bumps. These two terminal projections, with the central
furrow which divides them, and the ribs marking additions, which
match on either side, are evidence of work done in two parts, in
which the artist has followed the rules of symmetry, the first
condition of the beautiful.</p>

<p>The front part is of rather smaller diameter and is cut off on a
slant, which enables the jar to be lifted and supported on the
larva's back as it moves. Lastly, the mouth is circular, with a blunt
edge.</p>

<p>Any one finding one of these jars for the first time, among the
stones at the foot of an oak, and wondering what its origin could be,
would be greatly puzzled. Is it the stone of some unknown fruit,
emptied of its kernel by the patient tooth of the Field-mouse? Is it
the capsule of a plant, from which the lid <a name="page453"></a>has dropped, allowing the
seeds to fall? It has all the accuracy, all the elegance of the
masterpieces of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>After learning the origin of the object, he would be no less doubtful
as to the nature of the materials, or rather of their cement. Water
will not soften, will not disintegrate the shell. This must be so,
else the first shower of rain would reduce the grub's garment to
pulp. Fire does not affect it greatly either. When exposed to the
flame of a candle, the jar, without changing shape, loses its brown
colour and assumes the tint of burnt ferruginous earth. The
groundwork of the material therefore is of a mineral nature. It
remains for us to discover what the cement can be that gives the
earthy element its brown colour, holds it together and makes it
solid.</p>

<p>The grub is ever on its guard. At the least flurry, it shrinks into
its shell and does not budge for a long time. Let us be as patient as
the grub. We shall surely, some day or other, manage to surprise it
at work. And indeed I do. It suddenly backs into its jar,
disappearing inside entirely. In a moment it reappears, carrying a
brown pellet in its mandibles. It kneads the pellet and works it up
with a little earth gathered on the threshold of its dwelling; it
softens the <a name="page454"></a>mixture as required and then spreads it artistically in a
thin strip on the edge of the sheath.</p>

<p>The legs take no part in the job. Only the mandibles and the palpi
work, acting as tub, trowel, beater and roller in one.</p>

<p>Once more the grub backs into its shell: once more it returns,
bringing a second clod, which is prepared and used in the same
manner. Five or six times over, it repeats the process, until the
whole circumference of the mouth has been increased by the addition
of a rim.</p>

<p>The potter's compound, as we have seen, consists of two ingredients.
One of these, the first earth that comes to hand, is collected on the
threshold of the workshop; the other is fetched from inside the pot,
for, each time that the grub returns, I see it carrying a brown
pellet in its teeth. What does it keep in the back-shop? Though we
can scarcely find out by direct observation, we can at least guess.</p>

<p>Observe that the jar is absolutely closed behind, without the
smallest waste-pipe by which the physiological needs from which the
grub is certainly not immune can be relieved. The grub is boxed in
and never stirs out of doors. What becomes of its excretions? <a name="page455"></a>Well,
they are evacuated at the bottom of the pot. By a gentle movement of
the rump, the product is spread upon the walls, strengthening the
coat and giving it a velvet lining.</p>

<p>It is better than a lining; it is a precious store of putty. When the
grub wants to repair its shell or to enlarge it to fit its figure,
which increases daily, it proceeds to clean out its cess-pool. It
turns round and, with the tips of its mandibles, collects singly,
from the back, the brown pellets which it has only to work up with a
little earth to make a ceramic paste of the highest quality.</p>

<p>Observe also that the grub's pottery is shaped like the legs of our
peg-top trousers and is wider inside than at the opening. This
excessive girth has its obvious use. It enables the animal to bend
and turn when the contents of the cess-pit are needed for a fresh
course of masonry.</p>

<p>A garment should be neither too short nor too tight. It is not enough
to add a piece which lengthens it as the body grows longer; we must
also see that it has sufficient fulness not to hamper the wearer and
to give him liberty of movement.</p>

<p>The Snail and all the molluscs with turbinate shells increase the
diameter of their corkscrew staircase by degrees, so that the last
<a name="page456"></a>whorl is always an exact measure of their actual condition. The lower
whorls, those of childhood, when they become too narrow, are not
abandoned, it is true; they become lumber-rooms in which the organs
of least importance to active life find shelter, drawn out into a
slender appendage. The essential portion of the animal is lodged in
the upper story, which increases in capacity.</p>

<p>The big Broken Bulimus, that lover of crumbling walls and limestone
rocks leaning in the sun, sacrifices the graces of symmetry to
utility. When the lower spirals are no longer wide enough, he
abandons them altogether and moves higher up, into the spacious
staircase of recent formation. He closes the occupied part with a
stout partition-wall at the back; then, dashing against the sharp
stones, he chips off the superfluous portion, the hovel not fit to
live in. The broken shell loses its accurate form in the process, but
gains in lightness.</p>

<p>The Clythra does not employ the Bulimus' method. It also disdains
that of our dressmakers, who split the overtight garment and let in a
piece of suitable width between the edges of the opening. To break
the jar when it becomes too small would be a wilful waste of
material; to split it lengthwise and <a name="page457"></a>increase its capacity by
inserting a strip would be an imprudent expedient, which would expose
the occupant to danger during the slow work of repair. The hermit of
the jar can do better than that. It knows how to enlarge its gown
while leaving it, except for its fulness, as it was before.</p>

<p>Its paradoxical method is this: of the lining it makes cloth,
bringing to the outside what was inside. Little by little, as the
need makes itself felt, the grub scrapes and strips the interior of
its cell. Reduced to a soft paste by means of a little putty
furnished by the intestine, the scrapings are applied over the whole
of the outer surface, down to the far end, which the grub, thanks to
its perfect flexibility, is able to reach without taking too much
trouble or leaving its house.</p>

<p>This turning of the coat is accomplished with a delicate precision
which preserves the symmetrical arrangement of the ornamental ridges;
lastly, it increases the capacity by a gradual transfer of the
material from the inside to the outside. This method of renewing the
old coat is so accurate that nothing is thrown aside, nothing treated
as useless, not even the baby-wear, which remains encrusted in the
keystone at the original top of the structure.</p>
<a name="page458"></a>
<p>If fresh materials were not added, obviously the jar would gain in
size at the cost of thickness. The shell would become too thin, by
dint of being turned in order to make space, and would sooner or
later lack the requisite solidity. The grub guards against that. It
has in front of it as much earth as it can wish for; it keeps putty
in a back-shop; and the factory which produces it never slacks work.
There is nothing to prevent it from thickening the structure at will
and adding as much material as it thinks proper to the inner
scrapings from the shell.</p>

<p>Invariably clad in a garment that is an exact fit, neither too loose
nor too tight, the grub, when the cold weather comes, closes the
mouth of its earthenware jar with a lid of the same mixed compound, a
paste of earth and stercoral cement. It then turns round and makes
its preparations for the metamorphosis, with its head at the back of
the pot and its stern near the entrance, which will not be opened
again. It reaches the adult stage in April and May, when the ilex
becomes covered with tender shoots, and emerges from its shell by
breaking open the hinder end. Now come the days of revelry on the
leafage, in the mild morning sun.</p>

<p>The Clythra's jar is a piece of work <a name="page459"></a>entailing no little delicacy of
execution. I can quite well see how the grub lengthens and enlarges
it; but I cannot imagine how it begins it. If it has nothing to serve
as a mould and a base, how does it set to work to assemble the first
layers of paste into a neatly-shaped cup?</p>

<p>Our potters have their lathe, the tray which keeps the work rotating
and implements to determine its outline. Could the Clythra, an
exceptional ceramic artist, work without a base and without a guide?
It strikes me as an insurmountable difficulty. I know the insect to
be capable of many remarkable industrial feats; but, before admitting
that the jar can be based on nothing, we should have to see the
new-born artist at work. Perhaps it has resources bequeathed to it by
its mother; perhaps the egg presents peculiarities which will solve
the riddle. Let us rear the insect, collect its eggs; then the
pottery will tell us the secret of its beginnings.</p>

<p>I install three species of Clythræ under wire-gauze covers, each with
a bed of sand and a bottle of water containing a few young
ilex-shoots, which I renew as and when they fade. All three species
are common on the holm-oak: they are the Long-legged Clythra (<i>C.
longipes</i>, FAB.), the Four-spotted <a name="page460"></a>Clythra (<i>C. quadripunctata</i>,
LIN.), and the Taxicorn Clythra (<i>C. taxicornis</i>, FAB.).</p>

<p>I set up a second menagerie with some Cryptocephali, who are closely
related to the Clythræ. The inmates are the Ilex Cryptocephalus (<i>C.
ilicis</i>, OLIV.), the Two-spotted Cryptocephalus (<i>C. bipunctatus</i>,
LIN.) and the Golden Cryptocephalus (<i>C. hypochoeridis</i>, LIN.), who
wears a resplendent costume. For the first two I provide sprigs of
ilex; for the third, the heads of a centaury (<i>Centaurea aspera</i>),
which is the favourite plant of this living gem.</p>

<p>There is nothing striking in the habits of my captives, who spend the
morning very quietly, the first five browsing on their oak-leaves and
the sixth on her centaury-blooms. When the sun grows hot, they fly
from the bunch of leaves in the centre to the wire trellis and back
from the trellis to the leaves, or wander about the top of the cage
in a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>Every moment couples are formed. They pester each other, pair without
preliminaries, part without regrets and begin elsewhere all over
again. Life is sweet; and there are enough for all to choose from.
Several are persistent. Mounted on the back of the patient female,
who lowers her head and seems <a name="page461"></a>untouched by the passionate storm, they
shake her violently. Thus do the amorous insects declare their flame
and win the consent of the hesitating fair.</p>

<p>The attitude of the couple now tells us the use of a certain organic
detail peculiar to the Clythra. In several species, though not in
all, the males' fore-legs are of inordinate length. What is the
object of these extravagant arms, these curious grappling-irons out
of all proportion to the insect's size? The Grasshoppers and Locusts
prolong their hind-legs into levers to assist them in leaping. There
is nothing of the sort here: it is the fore-legs which are
exaggerated; and their excessive length has nothing to do with
locomotion. The insect, whether resting or walking, seems even to be
embarrassed by these outrageous stilts, which it bends awkwardly and
tucks away as best it can, not knowing exactly what to do with them.</p>

<p>But wait for the pairing; and the extravagant becomes reasonable. The
couple take up their pose in the form of a T. The male, standing
perpendicularly, or nearly, represents the cross-piece and the female
the shaft of the letter, lying on its side. To steady his attitude,
which is so contrary to the usual position in pairing, the male
flings out his <a name="page462"></a>long grappling-hooks, two sheet-anchors which grip the
female's shoulders, the fore-edge of her corselet, or even her head.</p>

<p>At this moment, the only moment that counts in the adult insect's
life, it is a good thing indeed to possess long arms, long hands,
like <i>Clythra longimana</i> and <i>C. longipes</i>, as the scientific
nomenclature calls them. Although their names are silent on the
subject, the Taxicorn Clythra and the Six-spotted Clythra (<i>C.
sexmaculata</i>, FAB.) and many others also have recourse to the same
means of equilibrium: their fore-legs are utterly exaggerated.</p>

<p>Is the difficulty of pairing in a transversal position the
explanation of the long grappling-irons thrown out to a distance? We
will not be too certain, for here is the Four-spotted Clythra, who
would flatly contradict us. The male has fore-legs of modest
dimensions, in conformity with the usual rules; he places himself
crosswise like the others and nevertheless achieves his ends without
hindrance. He finds it enough to modify slightly the gymnastics of
his embrace. The same may be said of the different Cryptocephali, who
all have stumpy limbs. Wherever we look, we find special resources,
known to some and unknown to others.</p>

<br>
<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>
<center>THE CLYTHRÆ: THE EGG</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>Let us leave the long-armed and short-armed to pursue their amorous
contests as they please and come to the egg, the main object of my
insect-rearing. The Taxicorn Clythra is the first in the field; I see
her at working during the last days of May. A most singular and
disconcerting batch of eggs is hers! Is it really a group of eggs? I
hesitate until I surprise the mother using her hind-legs to finish
extracting the strange germ which issues slowly and perhaps
laboriously from her oviduct.</p>

<p>It is indeed the Taxicorn Clythra's batch. Assembled in bundles of
one to three dozen and each fastened by a slender transparent thread
slightly longer than itself, the eggs form a sort of inverted umbel,
which dangles sometimes from the trelliswork of the cover, sometimes
from the leaves of the twigs that provide the grub with food. The
bunch of grains quivers at the least breath.</p>

<p>We know the egg-cluster of the <a name="page464"></a>Hemerobius, the object of so many
mistakes to the untrained observer. The little Lace-winged Fly with
the gold eggs sets up on a leaf a group of long, tiny columns as fine
as a spider's thread, each bearing an egg as a capital. The whole
resembles pretty closely a tuft of some long-stemmed mildew. Remember
also the Eumenes' hanging egg,<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> which swings at the end of a
thread, thus protecting the grub when it takes its first mouthfuls of
the heap of dangerous game. The Taxicorn Clythra provides us with a
third example of eggs fitted with suspension-threads, but so far
nothing has given me an inkling of the function or the use of this
string. Though the mother's intentions escape me, I can at least
describe her work in some detail.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Cf. <i>The Mason-wasps:</i> chap. i.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>

<p>The eggs are smooth, coffee-coloured and shaped like a thimble. If
you hold them to the light, you see in the thickness of their skin
five circular zones, darker than the rest and producing almost the
same effect as the hoops of a barrel. The end attached to the
suspension-thread is slightly conical; the other is lopped off
abruptly and the section is hollowed into a circular mouth. A good
lens shows us inside this, a little below the rim, a <a name="page465"></a>fine white
membrane, as smooth as the skin of a drum.</p>

<p>In addition, from the edge of the orifice there rises a wide
membranous tab, whitish and delicate, which might be taken for a
raised lid. Nevertheless there is no raising of a lid after the eggs
are laid. I have seen the egg leave the oviduct; it is then what it
will be later, but lighter in colour. No matter: I cannot believe
that so complicated a machine can make its way, with all sail set,
through the maternal straits. I imagine that the lid-like appendage
remains lowered, closing the mouth, until the moment when the egg
sees the light. Then and not till then does it rise.</p>

<p>Guided by the rather less complex structure of the eggs of the other
Clythræ and of the Cryptocephali, I think of trying to take the
strange germ to pieces; and I succeed after a fashion. Under the
coffee-coloured sheath, which forms a little five-hooped barrel, is a
white membrane. This is what we see through the mouth and what I
compared with the skin of a drum. I recognize it as the regulation
tunic, the usual envelope of any insect's egg. The rest, the little
brown barrel, broached at one end and bearing a raised lid, must
therefore be an accessory <a name="page466"></a>integument, a sort of exceptional shell, of
which I do not as yet know any other example.</p>

<p>The Long-legged Clythra and the Four-spotted Clythra know nothing of
packing their eggs in long-stemmed bundles. In June, from the height
of the branches in which they are grazing, both of them carelessly
allow their eggs to drop to the ground, one by one, here and there,
at random and at long intervals, without giving the least thought to
their installation. They might be little grains of excrement,
unworthy of interest and ejected at hazard. The egg-factory and the
dung-factory scatter their products with the same indifference.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, let us bring the lens to bear upon the minute particle
so contumeliously treated. It is a miracle of elegance. In both
species of Clythræ the eggs have the form of truncated ellipsoids,
measuring about a millimetre in length.<small><small><sup>2</sup></small></small> The Long-legged Clythra's
are a very dark brown and remind one of a thimble, a comparison which
is the more exact inasmuch as they are dented with quadrangular pits,
arranged in spiral series which cross one another with exquisite
precision.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>2</sup></small> .039 inch.&mdash;<i>Translator's Note</i>.</small></blockquote>
<a name="page467"></a>
<p>Those of the Four-spotted Clythra are pale in colour. They are
covered with convex scales, overlapping in diagonal rows, ending in a
point at the lower extremity, which is free and more or less askew.
This collection of scales has rather the appearance of a hop-cone.
Surely a very curious egg, ill-adapted to gliding gently through the
narrow passages of the ovaries. I feel sure that it does not bristle
in this fashion when it descends the delicate natal sheath; it is
near the end of the oviduct that it receives its coat of scales.</p>

<p>In the case of the three Cryptocephali reared in my cages, the eggs
are laid later; their season is the end of June and July. As in the
Clythræ, there is the same lack of maternal care, the same hap-hazard
dropping of the seeds from the centaury-blossoms and the ilex-twigs.
The general form of the egg is still that of a truncated ellipsoid.
The ornaments vary. In the eggs of the Golden Cryptocephalus and the
Ilex Cryptocephalus they consist of eight flattened, wavy ribs,
winding corkscrew-wise; in those of the Two-spotted Cryptocephalus
they take the form of spiral rows of pits.</p>

<p>What can this envelope be, so remarkable for its elegance, with its
spiral mouldings, <a name="page468"></a>its thimble-pits and its hop-scales? A few little
accidental facts put me on the right track. To begin with, I acquire
the certainty that the egg does not descend from the ovaries as I
find it on the ground. Its ornamentation, incompatible with a gentle
gliding movement, had already told me as much; I now have a clear
proof.</p>

<p>Mingled with the normal eggs of both the Golden Cryptocephalus and
the Long-legged Clythra, I find others which differ in no respect
from the usual run of insects' eggs. The eggs are perfectly smooth,
with a soft, pale-yellow shell. As the cage contains no other insects
than the Clythra under consideration or the Cryptocephalus, I cannot
be mistaken as to the origin of my finds.</p>

<p>Moreover, if any doubts remained, they would be dispelled by the
following evidence: in addition to the bare, yellow eggs there are
some whose base is set in a tiny brown, pitted cup, obviously the
work of either the Two-spotted Cryptocephalus or the Long-legged
Clythra, according to the cage, but unfinished work, which
half-clothed the egg, as it left the ovaries, and then, when the
dress-material ran short, or something went wrong with the machinery,
allowed it to cross the <a name="page469"></a>outer threshold in the likeness of an acorn
fixed in its cup.</p>

<p>Nothing could be prettier than this yellow egg, standing in its
artistic egg-cup. Nor could anything tell us more conclusively where
the jewel is manufactured. It is in the cloaca, the chamber common to
the oviduct and the intestine, that the bird wraps its egg in a
calcareous shell, often decorating it with magnificent hues:
olive-green for the Nightingale, sky-blue for the Wheatear, soft pink
for the Icterine Warbler. It is in the cloaca also that the Clythra
and the Cryptocephalus produce the elegant armour of their eggs.</p>

<p>It remains to decide upon the material employed. From its horny
appearance there is reason to believe that the little barrel of the
Taxicorn Clythra and the scales of the Four-spotted Clythra are the
products of a special secretion; and, now that it is too late, I much
regret that I neglected to look for the apparatus yielding this
secretion in the neighbourhood of the cloaca. As for the thing so
prettily wrought by the Long-legged Clythra and the Cryptocephali,
let us admit without false shame that it is made of fæcal matter.</p>
<a name="page470"></a>
<p>The proof is furnished by certain specimens, by no means rare in the
Golden Cryptocephalus, in which the customary brown is replaced by an
unmistakable green, the sign of a vegetable pulp. In course of time,
these green eggs turn brown and become like the others, no doubt by
reason of an oxidization which alters the natural qualities of the
digestive product still further. The egg, entering the cloaca in a
soft and utterly naked state, receives an artistic coat of the
intestinal dross, even as the Hen's egg is covered by a shell formed
of the chalky secretions.</p>

<p><i>Materiem superabat opus, nam Mulciber illic<br>
Æquora celerat</i>,</p>

<p>said Ovid, in his description of the Palace of the Sun. The poet had
precious metals and gems wherewith to build his imaginary marvel.
What has the Clythra wherewith to achieve its ideal jewel? It has the
shameful material whose name is banished from decent speech. And
which is the Mulciber, the Vulcan, the artist-engraver that engraves
the covering of the egg so prettily? It is the terminal sewer. The
cloaca rolls the <a name="page471"></a>material, flutes it, twists it into spirals, decks
it with chains of little pits and makes it up into a scaly suit of
armour, showing how nature laughs at our paltry standards of value
and how well able she is to convert the sordid into the beautiful.</p>

<p>In the bird, the egg-shell is a temporary defensive cell which at
hatching-time is broken and abandoned and is henceforth useless. Made
of horny matter or stercoral paste, the shell of the Clythra and the
Cryptocephalus is, on the contrary, a permanent refuge, which the
insect will never leave so long as it remains a larva. Here the grub
is born with a ready-made garment, of rare elegance and an exact fit,
a garment which it only has to enlarge, little by little, in the
original manner described above. The shell, shaped like a little
barrel or thimble, is open in front. There is nothing therefore to
break, nothing to cast aside at the moment of hatching, except
perhaps the actual envelope of the egg. Directly this membrane is
burst, the tiny creature is free, with a handsome carved jacket, a
legacy from its mother.</p>

<p>Let us indulge in a crazy dream and imagine young birds which keep
the egg-shell intact, save for an opening through <a name="page472"></a>which they pass
their head, and which, all their lives long, remain clad in this
shell, on condition that they themselves enlarge it as they grow.
This absurd dream is realized by our grub: it is dressed in the shell
of its egg, expanded by degrees as the grub itself grows bigger.</p>

<p>In July all my collection of eggs are hatched, each isolated in a
large cup covered with a slip of glass which will moderate the
evaporation. What an interesting family! My vermin are swarming amid
the miscellaneous vegetable refuse with which I have furnished the
premises. They all move along with tiny steps, dragging their shells,
which they carry lifted on a slant; they come halfway out and
suddenly pop in again; they tumble over if they merely attempt to
scale a sprig of moss, pick themselves up again, forge ahead and cast
about at random.</p>

<p>Hunger, we can no longer doubt, is the cause of this agitation. What
shall I give my famished nurselings? They are vegetarians: there can
be no doubt whatever about that; but this is not enough to settle the
bill of fare. What would happen under the natural conditions? Rearing
the insects in cages, I find the eggs scattered at random on the
ground. The mother drops them <a name="page473"></a>carelessly, here and there, from the
top of the bough where she is refreshing herself by soberly notching
some tender leaf. The Taxicorn Clythra fits a long stalk to her eggs
and fixes them in clusters on the foliage. While I cannot yet make up
my mind, in the absence of direct observation, whether the new-born
larva cuts the suspension-thread itself, or whether the thread is
broken merely as a result of drying up, sooner or later these eggs
are lying on the ground, like the others.</p>

<p>The same thing must happen outside my cages: the eggs of the Clythræ
and the Cryptocephali are scattered over the ground beneath the tree
or plant on which the adult feeds.</p>

<p>Now what do we find under the shelter of the oak? Turf, dead leaves,
more or less pickled by decay, dry twigs cased in lichens, broken
stones with cushions of moss and, lastly, mould, the final residue of
vegetable matters wrought upon by time. Under the tufts of the
centaury on which the Golden Cryptocephalus browses lies a black bed
of the miscellaneous refuse of the plant.</p>

<p>I try a little of everything, but nothing answers my expectations
very positively. I observe, nevertheless, that a few disdainful
mouthfuls are taken, a little bit here, a little <a name="page474"></a>bit there, enough to
tell me the nature of the first layers which the grub adds to its
natal sheath. With the exception of the Taxicorn Clythra, whose egg,
with its suspension-stalk, seems to denote rather special habits, I
see my several charges begin to prolong their shell with a brown
paste, similar in appearance to that with whose manufacture and
employment we are already familiar.</p>

<p>Discouraged by a food which does not suit them and perhaps also tried
by a season of exceptional drouth, my young potters soon relinquish
their task; they die after adding a shallow rim to their pots.</p>

<p>Only the Long-legged Clythra thrives and repays me amply for my
troublesome nursing. I provide it with chips of old bark taken from
the first tree to hand, the oak, the olive, the fig-tree and many
others. I soften them by steeping them for a short time in water. The
cork-like crusts, however, are not what my boarders eat. The actual
food, the butter on the bread, is on the surface. There is a little
here of all that the first beginnings of vegetable life add to old
tree-trunks, all that breaks up decrepit age to turn it into
perpetual youth.</p>

<p>There are tufts of moss, hardly a twelfth of an inch in height, which
were sleeping <a name="page475"></a>droughtily under the merciless sun of the dog-days, but
which a bath in a glass of water awakens at once. They now display
their ring of green leaflets, brightened up and restored to life for
a few hours. There are leprous efflorescences, with their white or
yellow dust; tiny lichens radiating in ash-grey straps and covered
with glaucous, white-edged shields, great round eyes that seem to
gaze from the depths of the limbo in which dead matter comes to life
again. There are collemas, which, after a shower, become dark and
bloated and shake like jellies; sphærias, whose pustules stand out
like ebony teats, full of myriads of tiny sacs, each containing eight
pretty seeds. A glance through the microscope at the contents of one
of these teats, a speck only just visible to the eye, reveals an
astounding world: an infinity of procreative wealth in an atom. Ah,
what a beautiful thing life is, even on a chip of rotten bark no
bigger than a finger-nail! What a garden! What a treasure-house!</p>

<p>This is the best pasture put to the test. My Clythræ graze upon it,
gathering in dense herds at the most luxuriant spots. One would take
this heap for pinches of some brown, modelled seed or other, the
snapdragon's, for instance; but these particular <a name="page476"></a>seeds push and sway;
if one of them moves the least bit, the shells all clash together.
Others wander about, in search of a good place, staggering and
tumbling under the weight of the overcoat; they wander at random
through that great and spacious world, the bottom of my cup.</p>

<p>Not a fortnight has elapsed before a strip, built up on the rim, has
doubled the length of the Long-legged Clythra's shell, in order to
maintain the capacity of the earthenware jar in proportion to the
size of the grub, which has been growing from day to day. The recent
portion, the work of the larva, is very plainly distinguishable from
the original shell, the product of the mother; it is smooth over its
whole extent, whereas the rest is ornamented with tiny holes arranged
in spiral rows.</p>

<p>Planed away inside as it becomes too tight, the jar grows wider and
at the same time longer. The dust taken from it, once more kneaded
into mortar, is reapplied outside, more or less everywhere, and forms
a rubble under which the original beauties end by disappearing. The
neatly-pitted masterpiece is swamped by a layer of brown plasterwork;
not always entirely, however, even when the structure reaches its
final dimensions. If we <a name="page477"></a>pass an attentive lens between the two humps
at the lower end, we very often see, encrusted in the earthy mass,
the remains of the shell of the egg. This is the potter's mark. The
arrangement of the spiral ridges, the number and the shape of the
pits enable us almost to read the name of the maker, Clythra or
Cryptocephalus.</p>

<p>From the very first I could not imagine the worker in ceramic paste
designing its own pottery by drafting the first outlines. My doubts
were justified. The grubs of the Clythra and the Cryptocephalus
possess a maternal legacy in the shape of a shell, a garment which
they have only to enlarge. They are born the owners of a layette
which becomes the groundwork of their trousseau. They increase it,
without, however, imitating its artistic elegance. A more vigorous
age discards the laces in which the mother delights to clothe the
new-born child.</p>
